This mission is pursued through the research component of the university programme especially at the post-graduate level. The senior academic staff teach  supervise and provide general academic leadership to post-graduate students who are expected to carry out research leading to the presentation of dissertation as requirement for the award of doctoral degree in their various disciplines. Carrying out the research enterprises involves a lot of corroboration among individuals and communities. The need to safeguard the interest of everyone involved in the enterprise makes the development of ethical standard in research imperative. Ensuring the development and effective application of such ethical standard falls within the leadership role of the vice â€“chancellors  Deans of post-graduate schools/ faculties  Heads of Departments and supervisors. It is the relevance and application of such ethical standard in Nigerian university research efforts that this study discussed. The study adopted the descriptive research design. A researcher-made 4 point rating scale was used to elicit information from the post-graduate dissertation supervisors sampled from one university each from the six geo-political zones in Nigeria using the purposive sampling technique. The data collected was analysed using the mean score and standard deviation. The findings of the study include among others that there are several cases of unethical practices by Ph.D dissertation students in Nigerian universities. Prominent among these include duplicating research topics  making unauthorized copies of data paper or computer programme  failing to acknowledge contributions of relevant people and authors  rigging an experiment to prempt the result among others. Some of the causes of the unethical practices according to the respondents include inadequate funding of universities resulting in inadequate remuneration for university teachers  inadequacy of equipment and infrastructures  poor supervision of Ph.D students â€™ poverty on the side of the student researchers and non-application of sanctions on violators. Improved funding of the Nigerian universities system with emphasis on both staff and student research efforts  admitting academic oriented students into the Ph.D programme and ensuring the application of appropriate sanctions in cases of unethical conduct in research featured prominently in the needed leadership imperatives. Based on the findings of the study  the researchers recommend the development of university research policies that is closely tied to each universityâ€™s strategic plan. Such plan should define the research focus that will attract more funding and direct students interest towards it without violating the principle of academic freedom. The plan should also incorporate the establishment of a research administration office to provide the necessary link between the students and funding agencies and also organise training for supervisors on leadership activities expected of them while educating students on the processes involved in carrying out a qualitative and acceptable research study. Such training should include the ethical principles and guidelines that encompass all parts of research from research topic through the literature review to the design and the truthful reporting of results  Keywordsâ€”Academic leadership  ethical standards  research stakeholders  research enterprise.  I.	INTRODUCTION I t is a normal occurrence for individuals  communities  and nations to experience one problem situation or another. At such times  varieties of ways are employed to find solutions to the problem(s). Globally  universities are established as research centres to find solutions to societiesâ€™ problems through the application of the rational mind to obtaining empirical data and processing them before drawing conclusions on whether the problem(s) have been solved or not [1].  	Research activities normally begin from the inception of a university by the academic staff in the various disciplines and extend significantly to students as the establishment of Postgraduate Studies. Postgraduate students in Nigerian universities are expected to carry out researches leading to the presentation of a thesis or dissertation as requirement for the award of the Masters Degree or Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D) Degree. 	Presently  Nigerian universities have produced a very significant numbers of Ph.D and masters graduates virtually in all disciplines without commensuration of contributions to national development research-wise. This is evident by the lack of research dividends accruing from Nigerian universities and lack of impact of research results on pressing socio-economic problems. 	The question arising from this report is therefore why is Nigerian universitiesâ€™ Postgraduate research not making any commendable impact on national development socially and economically? A number of factors have been identified as answer to the above question. They include lack of research focus  the preponderance of theoretical rather than applied research  lack of research and development in public and private sector enterprises  poor and inadequate funding. There is however an important factor that scholars  researchers  and stakeholders seem to overlook  the research ethical demands. It is this ethical dimension of research practice in Nigerian universities that this study focused on with particular reference to Postgraduate Studentsâ€™ Research. Literature Review 	Universities are established essentially to lead the search for knowledge. This major objective of universities can only be achieved through cutting edge research since it is the only means of producing knowledge [2]. Generally  the orientation of university research is geared towards finding solutions to societal problems in all areas; educationally  political  social  environmentally  economically and even spiritually. The quality of research input received from universities is a major determinant of the quality of life in any society. The research component of the university programme is pursued through academic staff research efforts and principally through Postgraduate research dimension. Carrying out the research enterprises involves a lot of corroboration among individuals and communities. The need to safeguard the interest of all stakeholders (researchers and participants) in the research enterprise resulted in the development of research ethics. According to Babarabe [3] there were no clear regulations in the conduct of research activities prior to the end of the Second World War in 1945. This led to several abuses by some scientists working on new weapon systems resulting in their committing many atrocities. The trial of some of the perpetrators of the atrocities and the charges brought against them in the Nuremberg Doctorsâ€™ trials of 1946-1947 paved the way for the emergence of first set of rules to guide the conduct of research [4]. The Nuremberg code was followed by the Helsinki Declaration of the World Medical Association of 1964 with its 7 basic principles. This was followed by the Belmont Report of 1979 from the National Commission for the Protection of Human subjects of Biomedical and Behavioural Research with its 4 basic principles.  	All the ethical guidelines according to Minnesota University [5] emphasize the need for the application of ethical behavior in research to all stages and aspects of the investigation from the planning stage to the execution and reporting stages including drawing conclusions and making recommendations. Generally  Resnik [6] summarized the ethical principles addressed by various codes as follows: honesty  objectivity  integrity  carefulness  openness  respect for intellectual property  confidentiality  responsible publication  responsible monitoring  respect for colleagues  social responsibility  non-discrimination  competence  legality  animal care and human subject protection.  	Similarly  the American Psychological Association identified five principles of research ethics which are commonly emphasized in Nigerian universities especially in the Faculties of Education. They include: discussing intellectual property frankly  being conscious of multiple roles  following informed consent rules  respecting confidentiality and privacy and tapping into ethics resources by ensuring that the rights of research subjects are protected and their voluntary participation acknowledged.  	Non-observance of the ethical standards at any stage of research amount to unethical practice which could invalidate the reported findings and render it false and misleading to other researchers and the public. Some unethical practices as identified by Resnik [7] include: using an inappropriate statistical technique in order to enhance the significance of the research.  â€¢	Conducting a review of the literature that fails to acknowledge the contributions of other people in the field or relevant prior work. â€¢	Not reporting an adverse event in a human research experiment.  â€¢	Rigging an experiment you know how it will turn out.  â€¢	Trimming authors from a date set without discussing the reasons in the page. â€¢	Assigning values to no responses in a questionnaire. â€¢	Making unauthorized copies of date  paper or computer programme. â€¢	Sabotaging someoneâ€™s work.  The damaging consequences of unethical practices in the research enterprises demands that universities as research based institutions should vigorously pursue the ideals of research ethics and institutionalize it so as to make their research endeavours worthwhile in meeting the needs and challenges of their society and the global society. It is the relevance and application of such ethical standard in Nigeria university research that this study discussed.  Methodology 	The study adopted the descriptive research design. A researcher-made 4-point Likert type rating scale was used to collect data from 120 Ph.D dissertation supervisors sampled from one university each from the six geo-political zones in Nigeria using the purposive sampling technique. The data collected was analyzed using the mean score and standard deviation.

A look at the table indicated that items 12  13  14 and 19 were seen as agreed by most of the respondents (supervisors) since their item mean scores were above the criterion mean of 2.50  while other items (15  16  17 and 18) had mean scores below the criterion mean of 2.50 and were considered as disagreed. The mean of means for table 2 is 2.56. The conclusion of this table is that inadequate funding  inadequate equipment  infrastructural problems and non-application of sanctions are some causes of unethical practices.

The results indicated that all the items (20-26) were held as agreed having mean scores that fall above the criterion mean of 2.50. The mean of means score of 2.76 was recorded for the items.  Discussion of Findings 	Analysis of data on the unethical practices among Ph.D student researchers indicate the most prevalent unethical practices to include: duplicating research topics  making unauthorized copies of data  paper or computer programme  failing to acknowledge contributions of relevant people and authors  using inappropriate instrument and statistical technique  rigging an experiment to preempt the result  failure to report contradicting or adverse findings and using false sample.  	The prevalence of such magnitude of unethical practices by Nigerian University Doctorate Students raises doubt on the validity of findings from some of the researches. This goes on to explain Mustpha [8] worry on the lack of research dividends accruing from Nigerian universities and lack of impact of research results on pressing socio-economic problems as constantly deplored by policymakers. Also  the occurrence of unethical practice in research on a large scale as reported in this study as in the case of plagiarism in form of mass copying of data  literature or computer programme  failing to acknowledge contributions of relevant people can result to personal and national economic losses.  	Data on the causes of the unethical practices found among Doctorate Students in Nigerian Universities show that inadequate funding of universities is a major factor because of its multiplying chain effect in contributing to inadequate remuneration for university teachers who are in most cases are made to exceed the approved student ratio for such supervision because of inadequate number of required teachers. This in most cases result to poor supervision of Ph.D students. Also linked to inadequate funding is adequate equipment  materials and infrastructures needed for quality research work. Quality research rests on the availability of the right facilities and the right environment. This seems not to be the case in most Nigerian universities where the required cost of up-to-date information  techniques and technology according to Manguwat [9] may be regarded as unreasonably large amounts of money. It is however important to observe that the funding challenges facing Nigerian universities is not peculiar to Nigeria but has assumed a global dimension. Clark [10] described universities in Europe as having entered in the age of turmoil for which there is no end in sight. According to him  â€œthe disjuncture is rooted in a simple fact: demands on universities outrun their capacity to respondâ€. 	Closely connected to the paucity of funds plaguing the Nigerian university system is the problem of poverty facing the student researchers. This agrees with Balarabe [11] submission that the high rate of copyright violations through the illegal photocopying of textual materials and copying of computer software including inability to embark on data collection are attributable to poverty/financial constraints on the side of the student researchers. Another important student factor identified is the admission of non-academic students into the Ph.D programme. Also indentified as one of the major causes of unethical practices in Ph.D student research endeavour is non-application of sanctions on violators.  	Manguwat [12] attributed this problem to many students pursuing Postgraduate Studies with wrong motive of using it to wage war against unemployment and not necessarily because they are interested or have the intellectual capability to pursue such programmes. They end up in every form of academic fraud. Failure to apply sanctions to serve as deterrent to involving in unethical conduct widespread and attractive to the researchers.  	The leadership imperatives expected of stakeholders (Vice Chancellors  Deans of School of Post-Graduate/Faculties  Head of Departments  and Supervisors) in university research enterprise based on the findings of this study include improved funding of the universities by their proprietors and university administrators by boosting the internally generated revenue machinery and ensuring curbing wastage within the system through effective utilization of resources and application of prudency in financial matters. Such well-managed universities with enhanced reputation will attract research grant which will serve as not only a source of help to the staff and students but also accrue to the university as administrative costs. Such grant will help the academic but poor student to avoid poverty-related unethical practice in research.  â€¢	ensuring the admission of academic-oriented students into the Postgraduate programme especially at the Doctoral level through well-organized aptitude tests and screening. â€¢	applying appropriate and adequate sanction in cases of unethical practice in conducting research enterprise through a well-articulated research ethics committee made up of reputable senior staff members.  Finally  the researchers recommend the development and adoption of university research policy in Nigeria that is closely tied to each universityâ€™s strategic plan as advocated by Makanjuola [13] Such plan should define the research focus that will attract meaningful attention and more funding and direct students to it without violating the principle of academic freedom. The plan should also incorporate the establishment of a research administrative office to provide the necessary link between the students and funding agencies and also organize training for supervisors on leadership activities expected of them while educating students on the processes involved in carrying out a qualitative and acceptable research study. Such training should include the ethical principles and guidelines that encompass all parts of research from research topic through the literature review to the design and truthful reporting of results.

MANAGING SAFETY AND HEALTH IN SCHOOL SERVICE DELIVERY AT THE EARLY CHILDHOOD AND PRIMARY LEVELS OF EDUCATION IN NIGERIA IN THE 21ST CENTURY  BY  PROFESSOR OBIANUJU OSITA OKU FACULTY OF EDUCATION  IMO STATE UNIVERSITY  OWERRI  Introduction 	Provision of adequate safety and health in schools have been rapid and widespread in recent years  and nearly all schools now give an appropriately high priority to getting their safety and health procedures right especially in developed countries. Addressing the issue of management of safety and health in Nigerian schools is quite germane giving the growing incidence of violence across Nigerian schools at all levels and the resultant destruction of lives and property. The chronicle of violent attacks on educational institutions has become a major setback to achieving Nigerian educational goals. In March 2012  12 public schools across Maiduguri were burnt  about 10  000 pupils forced out of school.  In Baga Community Secondary School in Borno state  more than 29 students and a teacher were killed as a result of attack by gunmen in 2013. In the same year about 45 students and some staff of government secondary school in Manudo  Yobe state were killed after insurgents attacked the school. Over 800 classrooms in Yobe state were destroyed leading to the closure of all schools across the state (Odunze  2013). The popular story of the missing Chibok girls where two hundred and seventy six girls were abducted from their school  Government Girls secondary school in Chibok town  Borno state in 2014 is not just a sad commentary on the Nigerian state but also puts a big question on the safety of Nigerian school children. 	The several terror-related incidence in the North East Nigeria  cultism and kidnapping related issues in the south especially south east and south-south Nigeria have instilled justifiable fears on parents on the safety of their children. They are now more concerned about the safety of their children than sending them to school. This  no doubt increased the number of school drop-outs significantly and no doubt must have swelled the Federal Ministry of Education 2010 report of 20 million Nigeria children of pre-school age being out of school  while 10.5 million children were out of primary school. Official statistics from the website of out-of-school children initiative  a partner organization  with UNICEF shows that Nigeria  alone accounts for about 8.7% of 58 million children of primary education that are out of school across the world which is rated as the highest. Researchers  have identified  several factors that may affect school enrolment  retention and learning to infrastructural gap  physical accessibility  sterility  of classroom  violence  hygiene  facilities and practice  recreational facilities   poverty  child labour  school management  among others (Nwogu 2010  Asoelike and Abraham 2011). 	A close look at the identified factors  indicate that they are safety and health related issues and is a pointer to the need for adequate implementation of existing universally established School Health Programme (SHP) and the local  ones such as the Safe School Initiative Programme. This paper is therefore an attempt to examine the issues of Managing Safety and Health for School Service Delivery in the 21st Century.  In specific terms  the paper will be handled under the following headings: â€¢	The concept  of safety and health in relation to school  â€¢	Historical overview of safety and health in Nigeria education  the national picture  â€¢	Key features of outstanding practices at the early childhood and primary schools levels. â€¢	The leadership and management of safety and health at the early childhood and primary levels of education in Nigeria. â€¢	Conclusion  The concept of safety and health in relation to school  Safety refers to the state of being safe from danger or harm. Similarly  health according to World Health Organization (WHO) is a state of complete  physical  mental and social well-being not merely absence of disease or infirmity. When used in relation to schools  it refers to the provision of adequate protection and right type of environment that will guarantee effective teaching and learning. It may be seen as series of harmonized projects and activities in the school environment for the promotion of the health of the learners and teachers and development of the school community. School health is as much as about pupils emotional and mental health as it was about their physical well-being. The United Nations convention on the rights of the child states that as well as in education every child has the right to be safe.  This is a call to education stakeholders to provide a healthy physical and psychological environment to ensure the safety of learners at all levels especially at the early childhood and primary levels. Early childhood education (ECE) is the overall development of the child socially  physically and intellectually. It is therefore conceptualized as encompassing the care  development and education of children below the age of six years. It is the foundation for a lifelong learning (Maduewsi  2008). The rapid mental and physical development that characterize the first six years of life demands that adequate attention should be giving to early childhood development and care. ECE is giving in Nursery and kindergarten schools in Nigeria. The proprietorship of ECE schools are mostly individuals and religious bodies under the control of the Ministry of education who formulate and ensure the implementation of policy guidelines. The same applies to primary education which is a reference to education given to children from age 6-12. Both ECE and primary education are included as part of Basic Education in Nigeria as stated in the UBE Act 2004; the inclusion of ECE in Basic education is an outcome of the realization that learning begins at birth. This has provided supportive policy implications at different sectors including Health and Social services. One of such policy is the National school Health Policy formulated during the Obasanjo regime. The Policy according to Dr. Oby Ezekwesili the then Minister of Education is â€œaimed at promoting the health  of learners to achieve the goals of Education For All (EFA)  and  outline roles of relevant line ministries like  Education  Health  Environment  Water Resources  Information and other stakeholdersâ€  Linkage between EFA  FRESH  Health-Promoting School (HPS)  Child-Friendly School (CFS)  Skill-Based Health Education (SBHE) and Life Skills (LS)                     WHO 2001. Skill for Health: Information series on school health document 9 cited in (National School Health Policy 2006)  The National School Health Policy (NSHP) is primarily basic education focused. The existence of such policy guideline is a right step in a right direction but the worry remains on how effectively the stakeholders have been able to implement the guidelines outlined in it. Can our schools be said to be health promoting schools?  A health promoting school is one that is constantly strengthening its capacity as a healthy setting for living  learning and working. Such schools foster healthy learning environment (WHO 2001). The characteristics of such schools include: â€¢	Location of schools away from potential environmental hazards. â€¢	Protection of the school community from excessive noise  heat  cold and dampness â€¢	Provision of adequate buildings  constructed in line with approved standards  with particular emphasis on facilities for physically challenged learners â€¢	Provision of an appropriate and adequate amount of furniture for learners and staff â€¢	Provision of an adequate number of gender-sensitive toilet facilities â€¢	Provision of adequate safe water supply and sanitation facilities for the school community â€¢	Provision of proper drainage and waste disposal facilities â€¢	Provision of safe recreational and sport facilities â€¢	Perimeter fencing of the school â€¢	Observation of Annual School Health Days â€¢	Promotion of healthy human relationships in the school community â€¢	Promotion of health related-school policies â€¢	Promotion of a maintenance culture	(National School Health Policy  2006)  What is the state of school health in Nigeria?  The first attempt towards introducing school health in Nigeria was made in 1929 in form of introducing a medical services that could cater for school children (Odutan  1972). Giving a historical background of Nigeriaâ€™s attempt at establishing School Health Policy (SHP)  Akani  Nkangineme & Orumabo (2001) narrated that a scheme was proposed that entrusted school inspection to medical officers with special training in that field  and a thrice-a-year examination of school children throughout their school years. In 1944  the Christian Council of Nigeria called attention to the high incidence of malnutrition among school children and hoped that government would inaugurate the proposed school medical service. In 1952  the government of western Nigeria published a policy white paper that contained a four-year plan to introduce a school medical service which would be available and free to all children. The objectives of this policy were to ensure that all school children received regular medical examinations  bring teaching of health into childrenâ€™s homes and also provide a liaison between the homes and medical authorities. In 1971  a school health service headed by a medical officer and assisted by other professional heads emerged at the Federal Government level in Lagos. Special clinics were set up to serve as treatments  points for school children with minor ailments  in some state capital  and large town such as Ibadan  Enugu  Kaduna  Benin City  Zaria and Jos.  	In Rivers state  a school health service unit was established in 1975 with operational base at Diobu Health Centre; it was manned by public health sisters with occasional input from physicians. The activities centered on occasional school inspection and health talks.

Received on January 30  1985.    Abstracts  The knowledge regarding the effect of  63CO gamma radiation on the integrity  of DNA structure is essential for radio therapeutic treatment for cancer. Studies on the profiles of the post-irradiation thermal melting curves of the eukaryotic N. crassa DNA showed that N. Crassa DNA  was very sensitive to radiation even at low dosage. A dose â€“ dependent increase in optical density at 260 mn after exposing a DNA sample when compared to thermal denaturation  curves of control or unirridiated DNA was found. The low GC components  (30 percent of  total DNA) of  N. Crassa DNA  which is primarily  mitochondrial DNA  were found to be  more sensitive than the high G+C major(70 percent) fraction consisting primarily of chromosomal  DNA. Results obtained indicate that DNAs from cell organelles  like  those of mitocohodrial DNAs  were more sensitive to 60CO irradiation.

Abstracts  The four medicinal plants  Garcinia kola (roots)  Borreria ocymoides (leaves)  Kola nitida (bark) and Citrus aurantrfolia (roots) were screened for phytochemical components. They were found to contain tannins  phlobatannins  polyphenols  hydroxymethyl anthraquinones  glucides  saponins  alkaloids  cardiac glycosides  flavanoids and reducing compounds. The aqueous and alcoholic extracts as well as alkaloids and cardiac glycosides of the medicinal plants were tested on various pathogenic bacteria. They were found to inhibit such organisms as Staphylococcus aureus  Klebsiella pneumoniae  Proteus mirabilis  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  ÃŸ-haemolytic streptococci  Escherichia coli and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The usefulness of the phytochemical bases of these plants as potential sources of pharmaceutical drug preparation is discussed.      ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  We are grateful to the University of Calabar for the award of research grants  and Mr U.A. Inyang (herbalist) who supplied the medicinal plants.

A. IZUNYA  A.O. NWAOPARA  L.C. ANYANWU  M.A.C. ODIKE  G.A. OAIKHENA  J.K. BANKOLE AND O. OKHAI. PUBLISHED IN BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY. ISSN (2010) MAXWELL SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZATION. ABSTRACT: The effect of oral administration of chloroquine  an antimalarial and antirheumatic drug on the histology of the liver on wistar rats was investigated. the treated group rats were administered 20 mg/kg body wt  weekly of chloroquine for 4 weeks while the control group rats were given distilled water for 4 weeks. on day 29 of the experiment  the rats were weighed and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The livers were carefully dissected out and quickly fixed in 10% formal saline for histological studies. The histological findings after H and E methods indicated that the treated sections of the liver showed cytoplasmic vacuolation; nuclear enlargement and vesiculation of the hepatocytes when compared with the control. Thus  our result suggests that though chloroquine may be a widely used antimalarial and antirheumatic drug  its chronic administration may have a deleterious effect on the liver of wistar rats and by extension may affect its function. it Is therefore recommended that the drug be prescribed with caution in patients with history of liver disease.  2) RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NECK CIRCUMFERENCE  WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE  BODY MASS INDEX  ARM CIRCUMFERENCE AND WAIST HIP RATIO AS PREDICTORS OF CADIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS. R.E. UCHEYA  S.E. OKONOFUA  L.C. ANYANWU AND J.C. IGWEH. BIOSCIENCES  BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH ASIA. VOL. 6(1)  87-100 (2009) ABSTRACT: Neck circumference (NC) as an upper body obesity index  is a simple screening measure for identifying overweight and obese patients. Based on the clinical significance of body mass index (BMI)  waist circumference (WC)  hip circumference (HC) and waist hip ratio (WHR)  this study examines a relationship between BMI  WC  WHR and NC. In a random sample cohort study the study group was comprised of 218 subjects (Male) with no known major medical conditions who were not receiving any medication therapy. With age (17-34) divided into two age groups (17-25 and 26-34) with mean values (77.06 Â± 0.56 and 82.97 Â± 1.5 respectively) showed a significant difference (P â‰¤0.05). Main indicators studied included NC  WC  WHR and BMI. Pearson's correlation coefficients indicated a significant association between changes in WC and changes in NC (r= 0.46 each  P â‰¤ 0.001) BMI and NC  (r=0.51 each  P â‰¤ 0.0001) Age and NC ( r= 127 each  P â‰¤0.05) but was insignificant for WHR and NC  (r=0.1  each P â‰¤ 0.07). Changes in WC  BMI  and age correlated positively with changes in NC but negatively with changes in WHR and the NC was revealed to be double the WC. This might be used as a reliable  simple  quick  and cheap method for predicting cardiovascular risk factors for coronary heart diseases and can possibly provide a very useful criterion for fashion designers for predicting waist circumference if a simple measurement of neck circumference is employed.  3) THE HEPATOPRODUCTIVE EFFECT OF VITAMIN C AND E ON HEPATOTOXICITY INDUCED BY ETHANOL IN SPRAGUE DAWLEY RATS.

PAKINSTAN JOURNAL OF NUTRITION 5(6): 507-511  2006 ISSN 1680-5194 ASIAN NETWORK FOR SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION  2006. ABSTRACT: Ethanol Liver Disease is a major health problem worldwide. One aspect of ethanol toxicity that has received increasing attention in recent years is the role of free radical species in the etiology of liver injury. Vitamins C and E  are antioxidants that scavenge for free radicals. the effect of 200mg Vitamin C + 200mg Vitamin E as food supplement administered for 7 days was studied on hepatic damage induced by ethanol (40% v/v  2.0mg/ 100g body weight per oral for 21 days) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. The supplements were also administered for the last week of 21 days administration of ethanol. Serum transaminases  Lipid peroxidase and Bilrubin were estimated to acess liver damage. Our results showed that ethanol induce increased serum Transaminases  Lipid peroxidase and Bilrubin levels. The biochemical findings were supplemented by histopathological examination of the liver sections. The study confirmed the hepatoprotective effects of Vitamin C and E on the hepatocytes of rats as demonstrated by previous investigators.,,Anyanwu Luke Chukwuma is a Professor of Anatomy in the Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences  Ambrose Alli University  Ekpoma.

About 65% of cancer deaths globally occur in low to middle income countries (LMICs) where prioritization and allocation of resources to cancer care are often quite poor. In the absence of governmental focus on this problem  this study was able to show that In LMICs  effective partnership between public and private institutions can lead to tangible strides in cancer control.

The stimulus for this study was the impending cancer epidemic in Africa. In Nigeria  this disease was found to be causing untold devastation  defining an imperative need to institute control measures. Breast  cervical  prostate  and liver cancers were found to be the most common types in Nigerian adults. In children  the predominant malignant disease was Burkitt's. C. E. Nwogu   E. R. Ezeome    M.

The Niger-Delta has unarguably been responsible for the generation of the huge revenue to the Nigerian State, and unfortunately at the receiving end of oil exploration and exploitation since the mid-1970S.   The region has been faced with the problems of oil spillages and gas flaring, which have caused serious atmospheric pollution, ground water and soil contamination, constant heat around the flare pits and abnormal salinity of the pool water, resulting in serious health hazards for the inhabitants, and of course grave disturbance to the life cycles of plants and animals in the region.  However, different interest groups have provided different answers as to the nature of the problems in the region.     Specifically, Iyayi focused on four major interest groups and these are:  (i) the Nigerian State, (ii) the Transnational Oil Companies (TOC), (iii) the leading Governments of the Western World, and (iv) the host Communities in the Niger-Delta.  These are explained hereunder:  (i) 	According to him, the Nigerian State has consistently held the view that the problem in the Niger-Delta is the criminal activities of the people in the region.  For example, consider the letter from President Olusegun Obasanjo to the Governor of Bayelsa State on 20th November, 1999 just before the military operation by the Nigerian State which wiped out Odi village and its inhabitants in 1999.  In that letter, President Obasanjo as the President and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Nigerian State was unable to make a distinction between those responsible for the actual abduction of the State Security operatives in the area and those with whom the Governor of the State was holding negotiations.  The President saw everybody in the State as criminal including members of Bayelsa State Government and the Governor of the State.  This presupposes that the Nigerian State epitomized by the President and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces saw the people of Niger-Delta as criminals without bordering to understand their predicaments.  (ii)	On the other hand, the position of the transnational oil companies is that the problem in the Niger-Delta is the attitude of the local communities to oil exploitation in their areas.  For example, in a recent interview with Friends of the Earth International in South Africa, which was captured on celluloid, the Managing Director of Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) Nigeria, explained that, but for the opposition of the Ogoni people, SPDC would have taken steps to redress the ecological damage in several parts of Ogoniland.  Good enough the Managing Director appreciated the fact that SPDC has done tremendous damage to the eco-system of Ogoniland.  Nonetheless, one may ask why it took the Company many years to recognize and appreciate this. (iii)	The governments of leading western countries tend to see the problem in much the same way that the Nigerian State and the oil companies view the problem in the Niger-Delta.  While they recognize that issues of development may be involved, they are more inclined to see it in security terms.  This explains, for example, the offer by the United States of America to train Nigerian troops for military operations in the swamps of the Niger-Delta.  (iv)	On their part, the local communities hold that it is the collusion between the oil companies and the Nigerian State not just to deprive them of their resources, but to set them against each other and exploit the resources in ways that have destroyed their environment and livelihoods that is the problem of the Niger-Delta. (Iyayi, 2006:1).  	The Niger-Delta with a landmass of 70,000 square kilometers is described as the largest wetland in Africa and among the three largest in the world.  The Niger-Delta is thus a difficult terrain.  However, the eco-system of the area is acknowledge as one of the most diverse and richest in the world, and therefore, highly supportive of human life.   The Niger-Delta is host to huge deposits of oil and gas.  The exploitation of these resources provides over ninety five percent of the foreign exchange earnings of the country.  (CLO: Blood Trail: Repression and Resistance in the Niger-Delta, 2002:9) 	In spite of accounting for a huge part of the nationâ€™s revenues, there is massive poverty in the Niger-Delta.  In addition to human poverty, there is also a poverty of infrastructures in the region.  The state of roads in the Niger-Delta compared with the state of roads in other parts of the country shows that the core Niger-Delta has many less kilometers of federal roads than several other parts of Nigeria.  Worse still, the available length of federal roads in the Niger-Delta is in a far worse state than what is to be found outside the region.  A recent UNDP Report on the Niger-Delta confirms this picture of the Niger-Delta.  The report highlighted the facts that various health indices such as infant and maternal mortality rates and HIV/AIDS infections rates are much worse in the Niger-Delta than they are in other parts of the country (Iyayi, 2006:3). 	Generally, the problems of the Niger-Delta are not only multi-dimensional, but also multifarious.   However, for the purpose of this paper, the following problems are identified: (1)	Since the commencement of oil exploration and exploitation in 1956 at Oloibiri, the Niger-Delta Region has not benefited much from the revenues generated, and therefore, has nothing tangible to show for it.  For example, the Western Region of Nigeria has Cocoa House in Ibadan, good road network, good schools, free education to show for cocoa exploited from the region.  Also, the Northern Region has good road network, infrastructural transformations in Minna, Kano, Kaduna, Abuja, Sokoto and other parts of the region to show for cotton and oil revenues in Nigeria, and the source of the oil revenue has been deliberately and criminally neglected over the years by the successive governments in the country. (2)	Specifically, in Edo State, oil exploitation started in Oben village in Orhionmwon Local Government Authority Area in the mid-1970S.   What has Oben village got to show for it?  What has Orhionmwon Local Government Authority Area got to show for it?  What has Edo State Government got to show for it?  Nothing, but bad road network, decayed infrastructure, abandoned projects, dilapidated schools, youth unemployment, women, youth restiveness and underdevelopment, kidnapping and a host of other negative vices.  (3)	The Transnational Oil Companies (TOC) involved in the oil exploitation have over the years not impacted on their host communities.  While the companies and their workers have been living in affluent, the inhabitants of their host communities have been subjected to extreme poverty and penury. (4)	The laws put in place by the Federal Government of Nigeria for the exploitation of oil and gas resources in the Niger-Delta by the transnational oil companies did not take the host communities into consideration, and had therefore, been flagrantly abused by the oil companies over the years. (5)	The region has become environmentally degraded through oil spillages, gas flaring with serious atmospheric pollution, ground water and soil contamination, constant heat around the flare pits which has resulted in the loss of aquatic lives, indiscriminate construction of canals and waste dumping, embarking upon major oil and gas exploitation activities without conducting Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) and so on. (6)	The Niger-Delta has become an ecological wasteland.  Several major rivers are heavily polluted; farmlands are under acid rain and oil spills, and carbon dioxide emissions in the area are among the highest in the world.  It has been calculated that some 45.8 billion kilowatts of heat are discharged into the atmosphere of the region from flaring, 1.8 billion cubic feet of gas every day (Agbola and Olurin, 2003). (7)	Intra and inter community conflicts have become a major phenomenon in the region as a result of the bribery and blocking of the community elders and elites by the transnational oil companies. (8)	Community leaders who opposed the policies and activities of both the government and the transnational oil companies are often arrested and detained, and some of them have lost their lives, for example, Isaac Adaka Boro, Ken Saro-Wiwa and his Ogoni compatriots in November,1999, just to mention a few. (Agbebaku, 2003:152). (9)	Inhabitants of the region, which include, elders, women, children and youths have resorted to various forms of resistance due to their continued neglect, deprivation and dehumanization.  These have resulted in demonstrations and protests, petitions writing, legal actions, hostage taking, kidnapping, armed uprising and community mobilization, pipelines damage and vandalization have assumed new and alarming dimensions. (Okecha, 2003:25-28)   Review of Related Literature on Niger -Delta Region Nigeria is the worldâ€™s 13th largest oil producer, and the 6th largest in OPEC. In the domestic sector, from 1970 to 1999, oil generated almost $231 billion for the Nigerian economy, constituting between 21 and 48 percent of GDP. Nigeria has an estimated oil reserve of 32 billion barrels â€“ sufficient for 37 years at the current rate of production (Heymans and Pycroft, 2003). Oil dominates the Nigerian economy. Between 2000 and 2004, oil accounted for around 79.5% of total government revenues and around 97% of foreign exchange revenues (UNDP, 2006). This rise in oil wealth has not translated into significant increases in living standards in Nigeria.   In fact, the rise in poverty and inequality coincides with the discovery and export of oil in Nigeria. As (Sala-i-Martin and Subramanian 2003:4) show, in 1965, when oil revenue was about US$33 per capita, GDP per capita was US$245. In 2000, when oil revenues were US$325 per capita, GDP per capita was stalled at the 1965 level. Evidence such as this has led to widespread acceptance that Nigeria has suffered from the resource curse and according to Sala-i-Martin and Subramanian (2003:24), waste and poor institutional quality stemming from oil has been primarily responsible for Nigeriaâ€™s poor long-run economic performance. The Niger-Delta region is the area covered by the natural delta of the Niger River and the areas to the east and west. The broader of Niger Delta region consists of nine states (Abia, Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Imo, Ondo and Rivers) and 185 local governments (UNDP, 2006: 44). The estimated regional population is nearly 30 million people. Difficult topography encourages people to gather in small communities. Of the estimated 13,329 settlements in the Niger Delta, approximately 94% have populations of less than 5000 people (UNDP, 2006: 15). The oil boom in Nigeria has been driven by oil extracted from the Niger Delta region.  Oil wealth, from the Niger Delta region, is largely responsible for sustaining the Nigerian Federation (UNDP, 2006: 62). Despite fuelling much of Nigeriaâ€™s economic growth, the Niger Delta is somewhat marginalized from Nigeriaâ€™s national development. Essentially, there is a significant disconnect between the wealth the region generates for the Nigerian Federation and the transnational oil companies extracting oil from the region, and the regionâ€™s human development progress.  Analysis of poverty and human development indicators paints a dismal picture for the Niger Delta.  Poverty incidence increased in the Niger Delta between 1980 and 2004 as shown in Table I below:  Table I: Incidence of Poverty in the Niger-Delta Region - 1980-2004 Country/States	1980	1985	1992	1996	2004 Nigeria	28.1	46.3	42.7	65.6	54.4 Edo/Delta	19.8	52.4	33.9	56.1	Delta 45.35   Edo 33.09 Cross River	10.2	41.9	45.5	66.9	41.61 Imo/Abia	14.4	33.1	49.9	56.2	Imo 27.39 Abia 22.27 Ondo	24.9	47.3	46.6	71.6	42.15 Rivers/Bayelsa	7.2	44.4	43.4	44.3	Rivers   29.09 Bayelsa 19.98 Source: National Bureau of Statistics The regionâ€™s human development index is 0.564 and while this is slightly higher than the Nigerian HDI of 0.448, the area rates far below regions or countries with similar gas or oil reserves (Venezuela is 0.772 and Indonesia is 0.697) (UNDP, 2006: 15).  When further disaggregated to the local government level, the Niger Delta Human Development Report shows that state and regional HDI scores mark inequalities in human development among oil producing communities. Significantly, local government areas without oil facilities appear to have fewer poor people than those with oil facilities (UNDP, 2006: 15). The report also concludes that decline in the HDI has been steeper for the Niger Delta states than the rest of Nigeria (UNDP, 2006: 137).   In addition, the high earnings of some oil industry workers leads to localized price distortions, driving up prices and so constraining the purchasing power of ordinary people and making it difficult for many to meet the costs of basic needs such as: housing, healthcare, transportation, education and making poverty more pervasive than conventional measures reveal (UNDP, 2006: 57). Comparatively, poverty and inequality in Nigeria has strong regional concentrations, resulting in significant levels of regional disparity.  Table 2 below shows that poverty is considerably higher in the Northern part than the Southern part of Nigeria:           Table 2:    Trends in Poverty Levels by Zones in Nigeria (1980-2004) Zone	1980	1985	1992	1996	2004 South South	13.2	45.7	40.8	58.2	35.1 South East	12.9	30.4	41.0	53.5	26.7 South West	13.4	38.6	43.1	60.9	43.0 North Central	32.2	50.8	46.0	64.7	67.0 North East	35.6	54.9	54.0	70.1	72.2 North West	37.7	52.1	36.5	77.5	71.2 Source: National Bureau of Statistics  It is germane to state that the poverty of the Northern part of Nigeria is more in terms of human development index (HDI) than infrastructural development index (IDI).  On the other hand, the Niger Delta region has better developed human capital through individual self effort, but infrastructurally rejected, neglected and marginalized by the Federal Government of Nigeria.  The poverty of the North as recognized by the colonial masters led to the amalgamation of the Northern and Southern Protectorates in 1914, as the surpluses from the South was used to net-off the deficit from the Northern part of the country after the amalgamation.   Regrettably, the poverty level of the North had consistently dragged back and prevented the South from developing; especially the Niger Delta region where the major source of revenue to the federation is derived from.  The Niger Delta region today is a place of frustrated expectations and deep-rooted mistrust. Unprecedented restiveness at times erupts in violence. Long years of neglect and conflict have fostered a siege mentality specifically among youths who feel they are condemned to a future without hope and see conflict as a strategy to escape deprivation.  While turmoil in the delta has many sources and motivations, the preeminent underlying cause is the historical failure of governance at all levels. Declining economic performance leading to rising unemployment or underemployment; the lack of access to basic necessities of life like water, shelter, food and clothing; discriminatory policies that deny access to positions of authority and prevent people from participating in shaping the rules that govern their lives â€“ these all indicate that governance overtime has fallen short of the peopleâ€™s expectations (Wifa," 2008:3). Many Reports have chronicled the Regionâ€™s monumental problems. The magnitude of the problems of the people of the Niger Delta is best illustrated in the Report by the World Bank in 1995.  In a 1995 two volume study entitled; """"Defining an Environmental Development Strategy for the Niger Delta"""" was conducted by the Industry and Energy Operations Division of West Central Africa Department of the World Bank. The region is described in the following words: The Niger Delta has been blessed with an abundance of physical and human resources", including the majority of Nigerianâ€™s oil and gas deposits, good agriculture land, extensive forests, excellent fisheries, as well as a well developed industrial base, a strong banking system, a large labour force, and a vibrant private sector. However, the regionâ€™s tremendous potentials for economic growth and sustainable development remains unfulfilled and its future is threatened by deteriorating economic conditions that are not being address by present policies and actions (World Bank, 1995). The Report goes further to lament that: â€¦. Despite its vast reserve, the region remains poor (GNP) per capita is below national average of $280 (World Bank, 1995). The Report continued: Education levels are below the national average and are particularly low for women. While 76 percent of Nigerian children attend primary schools this level drops to 30% in some parts of the Niger Delta. The poverty level in the Niger Delta is exacerbated by the high cost of living. In the urban areas of Rivers State, the cost of living index is the highest in Nigeria (World Bank, 1995).  	  The Federal Government of Nigeria has        	     never been sincere to the Niger-Delta           	                                                                                                 people. Efforts so far made by the Federal Government of Nigeria  to ameliorate the problems of the Niger-Delta Region  	Since Nigeria gained independence in 1960, the Federal Government of Nigeria had made the following impressionistic efforts at ameliorating the problems of the Niger-Delta Region: (1)	The first attempt at addressing the backwardness, poverty and neglect in the Niger-Delta Region from 1956 when oil exploration and exploitation started found expression in the establishment of the Niger-Delta Development Board (NDDB) in 1959 by the Colonial Administration.  Unfortunately, NDDBâ€™s assignment suffered major setback with the onset of the Nigerian Civil War in 1967 as the board became functionally otiosified. (2)	In 1993, the Federal Government of Nigeria established the Oil Mineral Producing Areas Development Commission (OMPADEC) in line with the recommendations of The Belgore Commission.  OMPADEC suffered from lack of planning and collapsed leaving numerous unfinished projects.  Eventually, OMPADEC failed to solve the problems in the Niger-Delta Region, thereby necessitating the need for the Federal Government to return to the drawing table in order to improve the situation (Iyoha, 2006:5). (3)	In 2000, the Federal Government established the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) amidst opposition from activists in the region that the Commission would not be accountable to the communities, and would suffer from mismanagement and corruption.  Some Niger-Delta residents are already criticizing the NDDC, while the Commissionâ€™s staff had been complaining of inadequate funding.  In 2004, NDDC prepared a Draft Master-Plan for the region, which was estimated to cost US$2.9 billion over a fifteen year period.  Unfortunately, Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) rejected NDDC and criticized the Commission on the ground that it is: â€œa channel for further looting of the meagre sums of money allocated to the development of the Niger-Delta Regionâ€.  As if (MEND) was prophesizing, Nigerians were recently astonished to hear that the Chairman of the Board gave the sum of 800 million Naira (Nigerian currency), an equivalent of US$5.1 million to a witch-doctor to assist him consolidate his position as the Chairman of the Board, and one wonders how a paid employee was able to raise such huge sum of money.  From all available information, the effect of NDDC is yet to be felt by the people of the Niger-Delta Region. (4)	In 2009, the Federal Government of Nigeria established the Ministry of Niger Delta to handle the infrastructural development of the region.  So far and unfortunately too, adequate financial allocation has not been made to the Ministry and the implications of this is that the Ministry may fail woefully like its predecessors if adequate fund is not given to it.  In a nutshell, one can categorically infer without fear of contradiction that these agencies  were not really established to bring succour or development to the Niger-Delta Region, but mere impressionistic or cosmetic efforts, because it did not take the same Federal Government of Nigeria long time and effort to develop and transform the Federal Capital, Abuja (which is in the North) to a world class standard.  								     Development can only strive       in a peaceful environment Recommendations 	Governments at all levels in Nigeria must as a matter of urgency involve the ordinary people, communities, women, youths, community or ethnic leaders, traditional rulers, militants and oil companies in the following ways: (1)	Enlighten and encourage the communities to take part in the process of discussing their problems and suggesting possible solutions; (2)	Involve community based associations (CBAs), village councils, village heads, women, militants, activists, community leaders/elders, religious leaders, youth leaders and community youth leaders in interactive study workshops designed to suggest possible solutions and strategies for implementation; (3)	On the basis of the suggestions during the interactive study workshops, design training programmes and organize training sessions for them; (4)	Organize dialogue sessions, interactive workshops for traditional rulers, traditional rulersâ€™ council, women, youths and militant groups in each of the States and Local Government Authority Areas on how to solve the problems of each community; (5)	Encourage the formation of neighbourhood, creeks and village watch associations to provide surveillance and security for security personnel and company installations; (6)	Give voice to the socially excluded through the involvement of CBAs, ordinary peopleâ€™s representatives in a participatory process of planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of community projects; (7)	Transnational oil companies should reserve a percentage of job openings for qualified and employable youths in their host communities; (8)	Governments and the transnational oil companies should invest heavily and continuously on the training of youths from the host communities; (9)	Governments and transnational oil companies should adopt a deliberate policy of village, community and indigenes ownership of a fraction of oil companies operating in their areas through allocation of shares and profit sharing; (10)	Conduct researches into the possibility of using community based associations, village councils or neighbourhood assemblies at local and state government levels as possible organs for receiving, disbursing monies and implementing projects on behalf of the identified groups in the region; (11)	Oil companies should always implement the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed with the communities; (12)	Oil companies must strive towards the modernization of infrastructures and equipment, replacement of old and corroded pipes to prevent further oil spillage. Strategies for the implementation of the recommendations 	For proper articulation and coherent implementation of the solutions to the problems of the Niger-Delta Region, the following three steps of implementation are recommended: (1)	Short Term Strategy (Two Years Period) (a)	Organize enlightenment, encouragement and dialogue sessions with all the stakeholders, where they will be informed of governmentâ€™s urgent plan to commence the development of their areas; (b)	Commence immediately
