ABSTRACT This paper is of the view that successive governments in Nigeria for too long have neglected the rural/local communities.  There is very little evidence to suggest that past policies of government made significant impact in terms of accomplishing improved quality of life for the over 70% of Nigerians that live in the rural communities.  This study  therefore  advocated a model for roles and involvement of the local communities in projects/programmes design  execution  monitoring and evaluation.  The study concludes that the adoption of this model will lead to good governance of Local Government Areas in Nigeria and by extension enhance the quality of life of Nigerians. INTRODUCTION   The spirit of advancing the common good of the locality manifests in the involvement of the local community inhabitants in development projects and programmes.  Involving the local communitiesâ€™ inhabitants should form the basis of the current thrust in development parlance in Nigeria which place great emphasis on total mobilization of the available inputs within the community aimed at energizing their own internal momentum  and in the process meet the basic developmental problems confronting the communities.   The merit in involving the local communitiesâ€™ inhabitants as a focal point of good governance in local government administration is that they serve as a point of contact between the local government and the grassroots. Okafor (1982)   Communities in Nigeria in the past have maintained a strong tradition in the area of self-help projects. Okafor (1984)   Basic infrastructural facilities such as roads  bridges  markets  health institutions  primary and post-primary institutions have been provided in different parts of the country through self-help development programmes.  According to Okafor  community have the capacity to respond to specific local development plans  mobilize their resources in a collective way  adjust their organizations to the required needs  and devise their own appropriate management rules to cope with the situation. Okafor  (1984)       In the area of ensuring good governance  local communities have a vital role to play in acting as a liaison in local government administration.  When given their proper place in Nigeria  they can be very effective in the area of collaboration or in partnership with the Local Government Officials (LGOs) in their effort to bring good governance and community development to the rural populace.   Local government as a concept has been subjected to a plethora of definitions.  Indeed  it has been seen as an ancient institution with a new concept. Ola and Tonwe (2003)   According to two British scholars Mackenzie (1964) and Whitaker (1970)  it is difficult  if not impossible to find a universally acceptable theory of local government administration.  This is so for the mere fact that the nature of the environment coupled with the specific cultures of a people determines the mode of organization they adopt in resolving their developmental needs. Ola and Tonwe (2003)   This has been one of the reasons why a definition or theory of local government administration that will satisfy all and sundry has been elusive. Wickwar (1970) 	However  in order to leave no doubt as to what local government is  it is imperative to give hereunder some perspectives offered over the years:  The United Nations Office for Public Administration defines local government as: â€¦a political sub-division of a nation or (in a federal system) state  which is constituted by law and has substantial control of local affairs  including the powers to impose taxes or to exact labour for prescribed purposes.  The governing body of such an entity is elected  or otherwise locally selected. UNO Summer Conference on Local Government in Africa (1961) 	This definition seems to have been widely accepted as reasonably embracing.  Both the Cambridge Conference on Local Government in Africa and the United Nations Conferences at The Hague on Administrative Aspects of Decentralization considered and adopted this definition.  Hugh Whalen added a new dimension to the definition in order to ensure its acceptability when he adds that: â€¦.each unit of local government in any system is assumed to possess the following characteristics: a given territory and population  an institutional structure for legislative  executive and administrative purposes  a separate legal identity  a range of power and function authorized by delegation from the appropriate central or intermediate legislature  and lastly  within the ambit of such delegation  autonomy  subject always  at least in Anglo-American tradition  to the limitations of common law such as the test of reasonableness. Whalen (1970) In view of the foregoing  it is necessary to explore how local government obligations to the populace can be accomplished in fuller measure through the activities of local communitiesâ€™ inhabitants in Nigeria. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM  	Rural dwellers have rightfully asserted their place in the scheme of things in Nigeria  as they have continued to provide the food needs of the urban population and also supply the raw materials for agro-based industries located in the semi-rural and the urban areas of the country.  Although  the rural/local communitiesâ€™ inhabitants remain the life-wire of the Nigerian economy  it has not attracted the needed attention from the government in terms of resource allocation.  There is very little evidence to suggest that past policies of government made significant impact in terms of accomplishing improved quality of life for these categories of Nigerians.  Most rural areas in Nigeria lack good water supply  motorable roads and electricity. Omorogbe (2005)   For example  according to UNICEF Report on The State of Worldâ€™s Children; only 39% of rural Nigerians have access to safe water.  Besides  health-care facilities are poor and very inadequate in areas where they exist at all.  According to the Fourth National Development Plan (Volume 1)  about 95% of the entire population of rural areas in Nigeria is not covered by any form of modern medical facilities.  Of course these problems need to be addressed in order to reduce the severity of the problem on the Nigerian rural people. Fourth National Development Plan (1980-85)   	As the role and involvement of local communities in entrenching good governance in Nigeria cannot be over-emphasized  Jibowo posited that: this segment of the population is important in a number of ways.  They provide the bulk of the food  which is consumed nationwide and sometimes exported.  They constitute the resource base of the nation and provide needed labour for industries and other service organizations located in the urban areas. Jibowo (1992)   It is  therefore  imperative that this teeming segment of the Nigerian population be assisted in the discharge of these duties by investigating the factors which may have impeded the good governance and development of the rural/local areas over the years  and also identifying and strengthening local initiatives that can help reduce rural poverty and dependence. 	Alila has proffered reasons for the lack of good governance in the rural/local areas in Nigeria.  These reasons include: inadequate programmes design  poor management/implementation  corruption  lack of commitment by government and inadequate development support institutions for this segment of the society.  However  beyond these reasons  the dismal failure of past regimes in Nigeria to tackle the problem of poverty and living conditions of the local/rural populace is traceable to the inability of the government to explore the democratic approach to governance in local government administration.  Much attention and thought seemed not to have been given to the fact that beyond governmentâ€™s efforts  the local/rural people themselves can meaningfully contribute to the development of their welfare. Alila (1998)   	It is now evident that the task of good governance of the local/rural areas cannot be left to the government alone; rural people themselves must have a stake in their own development.  This observation was also emphasized in an International Seminar on Review and Assessment of Local Governance in Africa.  It observed that: â€¦. unless there is full participation of the rural people in the whole process of local/rural development; there will not be any sustainable development.  Participation should be coupled with democratization of the rural masses and transfer of powers to the grassroots level. Mensah (1997)  Ihonvbere re-emphasized this point when he notes that: â€¦development is not really possible if it is not participatory.  External agents may facilitate this process  but they cannot even with the best of intentions consummate it.  In the final analysis  a people develop itself through its own exertions. Ihonvbere (1989) 	There is  therefore  great need to pay attention to the problem of improving the quality of life of local communities in Nigeria.  This is more urgent in view of the declining situations they face especially in the areas of health  education  water supply  electricity  knowledge acquisition and economic empowerment in order to ensure democratic governance in local government administration.  Local governments as the third-tier of government are expected to be the grassroots developers and mobilizers of the local communities  but unfortunately  over the years  local governments in Nigeria have not lived up to their expectations  as they have become conduit pipes for the wastage of public funds.  Local communitiesâ€™ inhabitants probably possess the strongest capabilities and promises for mobilizing and managing local resources.  This is because; they are organic units for the formation of self-managing organizations  which ensure collective and co-operative action in the execution of community development projects.   The roles and involvement of local communities in local government administration in Nigeria can never be over-emphasized.  Today  it is estimated that more than 70% of Nigerians live below poverty level; this further gives credence to the need for partnership between local government officials (LGOs) and local communitiesâ€™ inhabitants. Therefore  an establishment of model of roles and involvement of the local communities in the good governance of local government administration in Nigeria becomes timely and germane since local communitiesâ€™ inhabitants will help to complement local governmentâ€™s efforts in enhancing the quality of life of the rural dwellers. CONCEPTUAL CLARIFICATIONS 	For the purpose of this paper  the following words are clarified as used in this work: Local Government refers to a system of governance at the grassroots level.  It is the third-tier of governance in Nigerian federal system of government. Role simply means the duty(ies) being performed or  to be performed by inhabitants of local communities in order to bring development to their various communities. Involvement in this study means the participation of local communities in their own affairs.  In order words  the partnership between the Local Government Authorities (LGAs) and the Local Communities  (LCs). Local Community is the grassroots organization of society where majority of Nigerians live to perceive common needs and problems  as well as acquire a sense of identity and common set of objectives with their social relationships found within this area. Development generally means the improvement of peopleâ€™s life styles through improved education  incomes  skills acquisition and employment. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 	Governments at all levels can only be relevant to the people if the people are positively affected by the policies and programmes of such government.  Therefore  for government to be relevant to the people  it must assign roles and responsibilities to the people.  The people must work in partnership or collaboration with the government.  In this paper  it is our belief that when there is mutual collaboration between the local government authorities and local communitiesâ€™ inhabitants  the basic needs of the people will be adequately and properly articulated  developed and implemented to the benefit of the people. 	The Basic Needs Theory can be interpreted  essentially in four ways as follows:  First  Basic Needs means the provision of peopleâ€™s minimum requirements for water  housing  clothing  food and sanitation.  This obviously does not indicate the quality or quantity of food required nor what resources are needed for its realization.  Second  Basic Needs may mean allowing people to define their own wants rather than what is stated by experts or professional bodies  for example by earning enough money to buy what they see as vital services and goods.  Third  those who oppose the buyerâ€™s rationality model argue  instead  for government intervention in education  water and sanitation  and guidance in consumption.  Fourth  basic needs can also refer to the liberty of the people to express themselves through personal and group participation in planning and implementing projects. Streeten (1981)   The basic needs theory stipulates what human needs are and emphasizes the ends  rather than the means of development.  The emphasis is on development from the individual perspective and his or her mental  physical and social well-being  rather than looking at economic growth in terms of GNP.  Iyoha  (1999)	 Therefore  to adopt the basic needs theory  the local government authorities (LGAs) in Nigeria are hereby advised to utilize the model for roles and involvement of local communities in the development of projects/programmes as diagrammatically presented hereunder:             MODEL FOR ROLES AND INVOLVEMENT OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROJECTS AND PROGRAMMES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES IN NIGERIA             						           		               	In Nigeria  it is a truism that the gap between the local government officials and their local communities is immeasurable.  The Local government officials are in one extreme and the people in the other.    The reason for this gap is due to the well-known fact that the people do not elect the local government officials  and therefore  are not representing their local communities.  Rather  they represent themselves and their political godfathers who selected them into the political offices that they are holding. 	In a truly democratic society where governance is supported by the will of the majority  the local government authorities ought to adopt the participatory approach to development and this will include the assignment of roles  responsibilities and the involvement of the local communities in projects and programmes planning  implementation and evaluation. 	Therefore  in view of the wide gap between the local government authorities and their local communities in Nigeria  this paper is advocating the adoption of a model for roles and involvement of local communities in development projects and programmes of local government authorities as diagrammatically presented above.  The model is further explained as follows: (1)	Identification of local communities and their representatives:  This involves the inventory of the various communities in the local government areas and their representatives for the purpose of partnering with them in order to bring development to the various communities in the Areas; (2)	Inauguration of Partnership Meeting between Local Government Officials and Local Communitiesâ€™ Representatives:  After the identification of the various local communities and their representatives  it is imperative that there be a face-to-face interaction between the LGOs and Representatives of the local communities in order to create room for an enduring relationship and collaboration; (3)	Report the Resources of the Local Government Authority to the various Local Communities:  It is germane that all the resources of the local government authority be made known to the local communities so that the expectations of the people will be limited to the resources available to the authority; (4)	Report the Proposed Utilization of the Resources to the Local Communities:  When the people are aware of how their resources are being expended and for what they are expended  there will be mutual trust and respect for the LGOs.  The challenges of class inequality and class antagonism being presently experienced will be eliminated; (5)	Articulation of the Basic Needs of the People with Them:  The basic needs theory posits that projects and programmes of government can be useful only if the projects and programmes are able to meet the needs of the beneficiaries.  Therefore  the local communities must participate in the determination of their needs.  For example  in Esan West Local Government Area of Edo State in Nigeria  the local authority constructed a market at Ujuoelen road end of the Benin/Auchi expressway without any consultation with the anticipated users of the facility.  Because this facility did not meet the need of the people  the facility was rejected by the people  thereby wasting huge public fund; (6)	Involve the Local Communities in Planning Projects/Programmes that will meet their Needs:  The local communities through their various representatives should be given the opportunity to work in collaboration with the LGOs to plan projects/programmes that will be meaningful to them in order to avoid the colossal wastage of public fund.  For example  in Owan West Local Government Area of Edo State in Nigeria  the LGOs planned and executed a borehole water project for the people.  The project was sited in front of the community cemetery without any consultation with the people.   The people concluded that the water project was meant for the spirits that live in the cemetery  and therefore  decided not to fetch water from the borehole in order not to incur the anger of the spirits.  So you can imagine the amount of money that was wastage on the project by the local government authority (LGA); (7)	Involve the Local Communities in the Process of Awarding Contracts for the Execution of Projects/Programmes:   The LGOs should as a matter of utmost importance include the representatives of the local communities in the process of awarding contracts for the execution of projects/programmes in the localities.  Contracts should be as a matter of priority awarded to contractors who reside in the community (where possible) and the inhabitants of the community who are the target beneficiaries of the projects should be equipped with the details of the contract and contractor.   This will have the following advantages:  (1)  The contractor cannot afford to perform below expectation  because he lives with the people  and also  he will be one of the beneficiaries of the project;  (2)  The people will know who the contractor is  and therefore  hold him responsible for project failure and the people may even go to the extent of  compelling him to perform by attacking him and his family; (3) The present level of class hatred and antagonism between the LGOs and the people will be eliminated.  In this kind of situation  the LGOs will no longer need to go about with instruments of oppression of the people  as there will now be mutual understanding and peaceful relationship between them and the people; (8)	Involve the Local Communities in Monitoring the Execution of Projects by Contractors:  In Akoko-Edo Local Government Area of Edo State in Nigeria  a community elder informed our team that the LGA awarded contract for the construction of a pit toilet in one of the secondary schools in the area.  According to him  he went to the site of the construction and discovered that the contractor was using quarter-rod for the construction of the slabs instead of one-inch-rod.  He accosted the contractor who told him to get out of the site as he was not the one that gave him the contract.  The contractor even added that he can afford to use any material he liked because he has paid his due to the LGOs accordingly.   Discouraged by the reaction of the contractor and coupled with the fact that the LGOs may not listen to him  the community elder ended up with the following statement â€œwell it is government business and what is my concern in itâ€ The contractor completed the project unmonitored  and the LGA commissioned same.   On the day of commissioning  the Chairman informed the people that thousands of dollars were spent on the project and the audience applauded him for the achievement.  Two weeks after commissioning  a female teacher in the school who incidentally was the daughter of the community elder earlier mentioned went to ease herself in the pit toilet.  After easing herself  she dressed up  moved her first step out of the toilet and as she moved her second step out  there was a BANG  the pit toilet collapsed and the young lady narrowly escaped death by an inch.   From the foregoing  we can imagine the thousands of dollars that have been wasted on the project.  We can also imagine lives that would have been lost if God had not intervened early enough.  Consequently  LGOs should involve the local community inhabitants in the monitoring of all projects bearing in mind that the projects are constructed for the benefits of the people; (9)	Involve Local Communities in the Evaluation of Projects at every stage of Implementation/Execution:   The LGOs should always involve the local communities in the evaluation of their projects at every stage of implementation to ascertain the relative worth and compliance of the contractor with the project design  as this will eliminate the colossal wastage of public funds which is the hallmark of Local Government administration in Nigeria presently; (10)	Compare the Executed Projects/Programmes with the Articulated Basic Needs of the People:    Projects/programmes are geared towards meeting the needs of the target group.  Therefore  the utility of executed projects/programmes should be compared with the basic needs of the people to ascertain their relative worth.  This should be done by the LGOs in collaboration with the local communitiesâ€™ inhabitants/representatives who are the ultimate users of the projects. CONCLUSION 	     Over the years  the psyche of Nigerians has been militarized due to the prolonged period of military rule.  However  with the process of demilitarization starting in 1999  coupled with the commencement of the process of democratization of Nigeriaâ€™s political system  it is hopeful that the rule of law will gain prominence in our national life.   When this is achieved  the need to involve local communities in governance will become very imperative. This paper is of the view that successive governments in Nigeria for too long have neglected the rural/local communities.  There is very little evidence to suggest that past policies of government made significant impact in terms of accomplishing improved quality of life for the over 70% of Nigerians that live in the rural communities.  This study  therefore  advocated a model for roles and involvement of the local communities in projects/programmes design  execution  monitoring and evaluation.    Therefore  it is my sincere recommendation that LGOs should embrace the model advocated in this study in order to assign roles and involve the local communities in good governance of the local government areas of Nigeria and by extension enhance the quality of life of Nigerians.

By extension  the criminal neglect of the entire region was highlighted  and the various approaches to the de-development of the region were stated.  The impressionistic efforts made by the Federal Government of Nigeria to ameliorate the problems of the region were identified.  Thereafter  the paper posited a 12-stage strategy that could be adopted to solve the problems of the region with these strategies broken down into three phases of implementation.  The paper concludes that the implementation of these strategies would bring succour to the people of the region and thereby extricate them from their present extreme poverty level. Introduction          	Where there is no justice              there can never be peace.   	The Niger-Delta Region of Nigeria is made up of the following oil producing States: Abia  Akwa Ibom  Bayelsa  Cross River  Delta  Edo  Imo  Ondo and Rivers.  Oil as a natural endowment in a particular community  area or region  with its exploration and exploitation is expected to be an abundant blessing to such community  area or region.  Unfortunately and regrettably too  oil has turned out to be a curse to the Niger-Delta Region of Nigeria since 1956 when it was first discovered in the region.  The inhabitants of the region have been subjected to untold hardship through oil pollution  environmental degradation  destruction of aquatic lives  and other negative activities that are inimical to the existence and survival of the people of the region as a result of oil exploration and exploitation.  Oil was first discovered in commercial quantities in the Ijaw community of Oloibiri in 1956 in the Ogbia Local Government Area of Bayelsa State. Today  the inhabitants of this village/community are left with nothing but damaged farmlands and polluted rivers with no electricity  potable drinking water and other basic social amenities. Like the Oloibiri situation  the locals in many of the oil-bearing communities claim to still live in primitive conditions akin to that of the Stone Age  side by side with the high tech and modern facilities of the multinational community that they play host to. It is claimed that the advent of oil business in Nigeria has not really brought with it any tangible benefits; instead it ushered in high degradation of the Niger Delta environment  with concomitant poverty and much strife to the Niger Delta region. (Nisirimovu  2000:3). Today  the Niger Delta is best known as a region that sustains much oil exploration and exploitation by the agents of western economic powers. The Niger Delta basin is considered the mainstay of the Nigerian economy for its significantly high level of oil reserves. The region is also naturally endowed with viable deposits of hydrocarbon and gas reserves. Petroleum and derivatives dominate the Nigerian economy making up about 98 percent of exports  over 80 percent of governmentâ€™s annual revenue and 70 percent of budgetary expenditure. Crude oil resource gives the Nigeria government about US$ 20 million a day.   At the moment  Nigeria boasts of over 21 billion barrels of proven oil reserves. Nigeria is Africaâ€™s largest oil producer and the worldâ€™s sixth most important exporter of crude oil with the bulk of its exports going to the United States. (Onduku  2001) To a considerable extent  the geographical location of the Niger Delta and its resources determine the traditional occupation of the people: fishing and farming. But politics is the major issue of the day in the Niger Delta. This is mainly due to the long neglect of the peopleâ€™s welfare by the Federal Government of Nigeria and the nonchalant attitude of the Transnational Oil Companies. The people of the Niger Delta believe that they have no substantial benefit to show for their sacrifices  despite being the â€˜goose that laid the golden eggâ€™ â€“ the economic success that underpins the unity of the Nigerian state. They also believe they are now at that stage in history when they must actualize their own wise-saying which states that â€œanyone who takes what belongs to a child and raises his/her hand up; when he gets tired must bring down his hand and the child will take back his objects (what belongs to him)â€. However  security agents have always responded to demands put forward by the people of the Niger Delta in a brutal manner: many of the locals have been maimed  women raped and many have met untimely deaths. Local villages like Odi  Opia-Ikenyan  Okerenkoko and Ogoniland have been destroyed by the Nigerian military through the use of excessive force in counter insurgency measures. (Onduku  2001) Theoretical Framework The problem of conflict and insecurity is destabilizing the Niger-Delta regionâ€™s peace process. The fact is that whenever conflict occurs  the development of the society in most times is seriously affected.  Besides  once conflict occurs  scarce resources are inevitably diverted to the purchase of military equipment at the expense of socio-economic development. While many factors contribute to creating conflicts  this study is of the view that the Niger-Delta conflicts are mainly as a result of poverty rooted on continued criminal neglect of the region over the years by the Federal Government of Nigeria and the Transnational Oil Companies. Poverty is a multidimensional problem that goes beyond economics to include among other things  social  political  and cultural issues. Scholars have been trying to develop a theoretical approach to poverty and conflict for a long time. (Ikejiaku  2009:16). Burton agrees that poverty as a result of lack of human needs lead to reactions that result in conflict. The human needs theory championed by Burton argues that there are conflict and instability in developing countries because people are denied not only their biological needs  but also ,,,
sychological needs that relate to growth and development. (Burton, 1979).   The overriding importance of this theory is that, it understands that needs, particularly basic needs (such as food, water, shelter and health) unlike interest cannot be traded, suppressed, or bargained for, thus any attempt to do this, leads to conflict.  According to Aristotle as quoted by Ikejiaku, social strife and revolutions are not brought out by the conspiratorial or malignant nature of man; rather revolutions are derived from poverty and distributive injustice. Therefore, when the poor are in the majority and have no prospect of ameliorating their condition, they are bound to be restless and seek restitution through violence. No government can hold stability and peace when it is created on a sea of poverty. (Ikejiaku, 2009:16). The level of poverty in the Niger-Delta region has gone beyond the level of absolute poverty to the level of poverty qua poverty, a term coined by Ikejiaku to describe the practical absolute poverty where the majority find life excruciating because it is difficult to meet or satisfy their basic needs, such as food, clothing, shelter and education beyond primary school level.  It is pathetic that an average Niger-Deltan has grown poorer over the past decades, notwithstanding the enormous natural resources available in the region.  Poverty qua poverty is a situation no human being would be contented with, because of the agonizing pains that follow the lack of these basic needs.  Therefore, people in most cases react negatively to such situation, in order to show their grievances and discontent, particularly when the government is corrupt (Ikejiaku, 2009:15) as is the case with the Nigerian leaders. Conflicts are, therefore, often caused by an attempt to clamour for these basic needs by violent means.  Burtonâ€™s human needs theory on conflict and conflict management recognizes the indispensability of these needs, by pointing out that wherever such non-negotiable needs are not met, conflict is inevitable. (Burton, 1997). The costs of conflicts are horrific, and in many cases conflicts wiped out the achievements of decades of economic and social development. Armed conflicts, in particular, involve complete economic paralysis, immense social costs and trauma, political quagmire and disintegration, as well as serious environmental degradation and dilapidation (Ikejiaku, 2009:16) as is being experienced in the region for decades now. Problems of the Niger-Delta Region of Nigeria 	Since the mid-1970S Nigeriaâ€™s political fate has been inextricably linked to oil.  Petroleum accounts for over 80 percent of the governmentâ€™s revenue

Apart from the content of an individualâ€™s meal  the eating pattern or habit plays enormous role on development  general health and academic performance of young people in the school. Twenty-First Century is basically a unique century with peculiar health challenges of which a major one is safety. The development of vaccines and improvement in personal hygiene and public health have to a great extent impacted on reduction of pathogenic diseases. The need for security and safety at the school particularly has become a major health need in modern times with the threats posed by terrorism and natural disasters. Lifestyle disease constitute a major public health challenge as fatalistic behaviour evident in risky sexual behaviour  substance use and abuse among others pose grave dangers to humanity. Young people are at the centre of almost every sexually transmitted infection known to man thus making this vital population a threatened group. ,/home/peterok1/public_html/dop/components/com_rsform/uploads/CV_Anyanwu-Francisca-Chika_prof.-francisca-c.-anyanwu-s-cv.docx
