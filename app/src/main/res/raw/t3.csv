Abstract Introduction: The hot-dry season in the Northern Guinea Savannah zone of Nigeria is characterized by high ambient temperature and high relative humidity which imposes heat stress on the body resulting in enormous generation of free radicals and behavioural changes. Aim: The aim of the study was to determine the effect of ascorbic acid (AA) on behavior of Wistar rats exposed to environmental in heat stress. Methods: Thirty Wistar rats weighing 140-160g were divided into 3 groups of 10 each. Group 1 served as control and was administered normal saline 1ml/kg orally  groups 2 0 exposed to environmental temperature of 38 Â± 1 C and group 3 were exposed to 0 environmental temperature of 38 Â± 1 C and administered AA at 100mg/kg orally for 21 days. Behavioral activity in the open-field was assessed on days 1  7  14 and 21. Results: The results showed a significant increase in pellets count  urination and immobilization in the control and heat exposed group compared to AA treated on days 1 and 7. Rearing  grooming and ambulation were significantly decreased in AA treated st group on day 1  7 and 14. There was no significant behavioral change on the 21 day indicating habituation. Conclusion: It was concluded that ascorbic acid ameliorated some of the behavioral changes induced by environmental heat stress and therefore  individuals working in high temperature zones should be advised to be taking vitamin C supplements. Key words: Heat stress  Behaviour  Ascorbic acid  Open-field. Introduction The hot-dry season in the Northern Guinea Savannah zone of Nigeria  characterized by high ambient temperature and high relative humidity  imposes heat stress on the body (Ayo et al.  2011). Heat stress is the net (overall) heat burden on the body from the combination of body heat generated while working and for being subjected to environmental sources such as air temperature  humidity  air movement  radiation from the sun or hot surfaces (Threshold Limit V alues 2001). In all instances  the cause of heat stress is a working environment which can potentially overwhelms the bodyâ€™s ability to deal with heat. Continous heat stress induces large demands on physiological and metabolic processes to compensate for changes in thermal environment which can affect the well being of animals including man ( Gordon  1993). Heat stress is one of the most important stressors in hot regions of the world leading to enormous generation of free radicals (FRs) and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in overwhelming of natural antioxidant in the tissues leading to oxidative stress (Altan et al.  2003). 144 ï¿¼Citation: Alhassan  A.W.  El-Khashab  M.M.  Saleh  M.I.A.  Yarube  I.U.  and Lawan  I. (2016): Effect of Ascorbic Acid on Behaviour of Wistar Rats Exposed to Environmental Heat Stress. BJMLS. 1(1): 144 - 151 At the celluar level  heat stress induces the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs)  which is closely associated with adapted thermotolerancce against a sudden heat shock (Horowitz  2002). The expression of HSPs is known to be involved in an endogenous cellular defense mechanism that enables cells to cope with stressful conditions and generation of free radicals and oxidative stress (Molvarec et al. 2011). Free radicals play an important role in the functioning of the brain in physiologic and pathologic conditions (Drew et al.  1998). Heat stress can profoundly disturb the balance between the generation of ROS and the antioxidant defense system (Molvarec et al. 2011). The major outcome of oxidative stress is the irreversible damage of cell macromolecules by ROS leading to lipid peroxidation (LPO). Proteins are the major target for oxidants as a result of their abundance and their elevated reaction rate constants (Bizzozero  2009). The deleterious effects of oxidative free radicals are ameliorated by antioxidants. Scavengers of free radicals such as ascorbic acid (AA) also known as vitamin C may play a pivotal role in preventing the cellular damage of organs and maintaining homeostasis during heat stress (Seo-Hyun et al. 2012) Ascorbic acid  is a potent water-soluble  naturally occurring antioxidant  a cofactor in various enzymes and a free radical scavenger by its antioxidant effect (Frei et al.  1990). Currently ascorbic acid is the most widely used vitamin supplement throughout the world (Naidu  2003) due to its variety of biological functions (Maret and Jan  2011). It is an outstanding antioxidant in human blood plasma (Frei et al. 1989). Vitamin C has the ability to protect against LPO by acting as a scavenger of ROS and by one- electron reduction of lipid hydroperoxyl radicals via the vitamin E redox cycle (Halliwell  1996). Ascorbic acid has been shown to be of value in the prevention and therapy of adverse effects of stress factors. Clinical and epidemiological studies have indicated that ascorbic acid may be beneficial in chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer (Valpuesta and Botella  2004; Coulter et al.  2006) and the ability to fight off environmental pollutants including carbon monoxide  pesticides and heavy metals (Iqbal et al.  2004). The health promoting effects of vitamin C can be attributed to its biological functions as a co-factor for a number of enzymes ( Maret and Jan  2011). Studies on the effect of heat stress and nervous activities have been studied but none has linked it to free radicals and ascorbic acid. Materials and Methods Experimental Design A total of 30 adult Wistar rats weighing 140- 160g were fed pellets made from growersâ€™ mash  Maize bran and Groundnut cake in the ratio of 4:2:1 with Wheat flour as binder. The rats were allowed to acclimatize to the environment for two weeks and given water ad libitun before the experiment commenced. Group I made of 10 rats served as the control received normal saline and exposed to normal room body temperature  group II made of 10 rats received normal saline and exposed to environmental 0 temperature of 38 Â± 1 C and group III made up of 10 rats were exposed to 0 environmental temperature of 38 Â± 1 C and administered vitamin C orally at a dose of 100mg/kg daily. The experiment lasted for a period of 21 days. Drug Preparation Ascorbic acid tablets  Med Vit C (100mg/tablet). Each tablet was dissolved in 1ml of distilled water to obtain 100mg/ml suspension  just prior to its daily administration. Measurement of Rectal Temperature (RT) The RT was recorded using standard digital clinical thermometer (Hartmanâ€™s Company Plc  England)  inserted about 5 cm into the rectum via the cloaca for 3 min until an alarm was heard  indicating that the temperature has been stabilized Rectal temperature was monitored and taken daily for three weeks. 145 Effect of Ascorbic Acid on Behaviour Change in body temperature has been used as important criterion for stress reaction in animals according to Boulant (1991). Open-field test Behavioral activity in the open-field (OF) was assessed on days 1  7  14 and 21. The OF test was first described by Hall in 1934 and is currently a useful tool to assess behaviour. The open-field assessment was performed as described by Zhu et al. (2001) on day 0  7  14 and 21 of the experiment. The open field apparatus was constructed as described by Zhu et al.  (2001). Briefly  it was made of a cardboard box (50 x 50 x 46cm high) with clear plexiglas on the inner surface. The floor was divided into 25 equal squares. Each animal was placed in the box and allowed to walk freely for 3 minutes  and the recordings of parameters were made in the next 2 minutes. The apparatus was used to assess activity and locomotion of each rat. It was also used to evaluate anxiety in the rats by measuring the number of stretch-attend postures (risk-assessment behaviour) which was the frequency with which each animal demonstrated forward elongation of the head and shoulders  followed by retraction to the original position and a high frequency indicates high levels of anxiety (Blanchard et al.  2001) Other parameters measured using the apparatus were grooming  which was the duration of time the animal spent licking or scratching itself while stationary; grooming behaviour is a displacement response and is expected to be displayed in a novel environment (Espejo  1997). The apparatus was first cleaned with 95% ethanol after assessing each anima in order to remove the interfering odours left by the previous animal. Statistical Analysis Data was expressed as mean Â± standard error of mean (mean Â± SEM). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess the difference in mean values between the control and test groups using graphpad prism 4.0. V alues of p0.05 were considered significant. Results Table 1 show the body temperature distribution of heat stress rats supplemented with ascorbic acid. The ascorbic acid significantly decreased body temperature on days 1  7 and 14 in ascorbic acid treated group as compared to stressed induced animals and no changes were observed on day 21.

On doing so  the pipette was rotated until the fluid reaches the 101 mark [8]. The counting chamber and the cover slip were cleansed with cotton wool. To the counting chamber  the cover slip was placed over the central platform  1 cm of the fluid in the stem was expelled from the pipette and the remaining 100 cm content was mixed thoroughly. A drop of the blood solution was then introduced into the counting chamber by approximating the tip of the pipette to one end of the counting chamber. The counting chamber was mounted on the stage of the microscope and a magnification of Ñ… 40 was used to view the corpuscles. Counting was done after allowing the corpuscle to settle for few minutes. The counting was done in an L-shape pattern so as to avoid counting those cells on the boundary twice. Five regions of the counting chamber were counted [8]. Determination of White Blood Cell (WBC) Count and Differential WBC Count WBC and differential WBC were similar to WBC count  except that the magnification (power) of the light microscope was set at Ã—10 and Ã—100 respectively  instead Ã—40 in RBC count. Also  the WBC diluting fluid and Leishman stain were used  and the counting was in four regions of the counting with the counting chamber of the RBC in the middle [9]. Determination of Packed Cell Volume (PCV) The blood sample collected was introduced into the capillary tubes using the syringe. The tubes were then sealed by blue flames from spirit lamp. The sealed capillary tubes were then spun in microhaematocrit centrifuged for 30 minutes at 5 g. The respective PCVâ€™s were then read from microhaematocrit reader [9]. Calculations of Red Blood Cell Indices Red cell indices (Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)  Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin (MCH)  and Mean Corpuscular Haemoglobin Concentration (MCHC)) were calculated as described by Jain [10]. MCV = PCV x 10 / RBC (fl) MCH = HbC x 10 / RBC (pg) MCHC = HbC x 100 / PCV (g/dl) Statistical Analysis All data were expressed as the Mean Â± Standard Error of Mean (SEM). Analysis of Variance  and then Scheffeâ€™s post hoc test [11] were used to analyse the data. Any test with a p  0.05) affected by the treatments (Figure 1)  but there was at least a small reduction in the body weight in groups B and D (Figure 2). There was reduction in the PCV of all the treatment groups relative to that of the rats in the control group but the reduction was only significant (p  0.05) for group C (Figure 3). The mean total red blood cell count of rats in each of the Experimental groups B and C were lower compared with those in the control group with a significant decrease (p 0.05) decrease in the mean Hb concentration recorded for rats in the Experimental groups B and D  but significant (p  0.05) decrease in group C (Figure 3). Each of MCV  MCH  and MCHC was not significant different throughout the groups (Figure 4). On the other hand  WBC was increased in all the experimental groups relative to the control  but the increase were significant for only group B (p  0.01) and group D (p  0.05) (Figure 5). However  the differential count did not show any significant difference between there treatment groups and the control (Figure 5). As for the serum electrolytes  Na+ levels for the rats in all the experimental groups B  C and D decreased significantly (p  0.001) when compared to the control group (Figure 6). But there was no significant difference in the serum K+ level between the control and the treatment groups. On the other hand  serum Ca+ level was significantly (p  0.01) higher for group C but not for groups B and D (Figure 6). The mean serum Cl- levels in the experimental rats increased relative to the control  but only group C was statistically significant (p  0.05)  while HCO3- and HPO4- decreased significantly in all the treatment groups (Figure 7). There was significant (p  0.001) decrease in serum creatinine level  and blood urea nitrogen for all the treatment groups relative to the control group (Figure 8). Significant increase in the Total serum protein and Serum Albumin levels were noted in both groups B and C  but not in group D. But there was no significant difference in the Serum Globulin (Glb) levels for all the groups. DISCUSSION Relative to the rats in the control group  the PCV values of rats in the experimental groups were observed to have OPEN ACCESS ï¿¼ï¿¼Â© Research | Reviews | Publications  2011 http://www.rrpjournals.com/ OPEN ACCESS ï¿¼ ï¿¼World J Life Sci. and Medical Research 2012;2(5):162 ISSN 2249-0574 OPEN ACCESS Wahab et al.  2012. Effects of Solanum melongena on Blood System of Wistar Rats decreased dose-dependently (except for group D) (Figure 3). The observed (but dosage-inconsistent) slight decrease in the PCV goes in line with the noted pattern for both red blood cells count and haemoglobin concentration (Figure 3). The non-significant change in MCV  MCH and MCHC values suggests that eggplant (Solanum melongena) does not really have any haemopoeitic  and may not even have any serious haematotoxicity or general toxic effect as previously believed [5]. Our findings up to this point is (somewhat) in line with those of Adamson and Longo [12]. Slight decrease in haemoglobin concentration and circulating RBC with no change in values of MCV  MCH and MCHC may produce normocytic hypochromic red blood cells. This could only be possible in group C rats (administered 400 mg of extract/Kg body weight) where the decrease in haemoglobin concentration and circulating RBC was noted  and thus may not signify any particular significant threat/toxicity from eggplant. The differential cell analysis showed that there was an increase in the mean lymphocyte values. Increase in circulating lymphocyte values is associated with enhanced immunological status of the body  especially the cell-mediated immune response. Our findings here agree with those of Saba et al  [13] and those of Lowenthal et al. [14] who suggested that eggplant may favour the cells involved in immunity. The findings in this study (figure 5)  therefore  confirm that eggplant enhances cell- mediated immunity and thus boost bodyâ€™s immune system. Knowing that increased circulating neutrophils serve as an index of bacterial infection in the body [13]  the non-significant change in the value of circulating neutrophils even in rats treated with 800 mg/kg does not seem to have any special implication with respect to the administered extract  except that it may suggest that the animals were safe from sepsis and that other observed results can  in fact  be considerably trusted (as the influences of most non-random factors were kept out). In addition  one may still argue/believe that the reduction of mean value of circulating neutrophils in this study is somewhat (indirectly) due to the antimicrobial effect of the extract  which is in accordance with the work of Jorge et al. [15]. Serum sodium ion level was lower in the experimental rats studied. This may be due to presence of some sodium depleting base compounds in the extract or excessive excretion of sodium by the kidneys  but the later reason could not be affirmed since no specific test was done to very that. As (more) sodium is excreted  it takes with it (more) water  which could in turn result in weight loss OPEN Â© Research | Reviews | Publications  2011 [16  17]. This may  thus  explain part of the moderate weight loss noted in the extract-treated rats (figure 1). The noted reduction is calcium level could be linked to the fact that oxalate reduces calcium absorption from the gut. Thus the presence of oxalates in the extract  which could lead to reduced absorption of calcium from the intestine  is implicated. This agrees with the findings by Whitaker and Stommel [18]. In some other cases (not studied  in this research)  another possible explanation for similar reduction in calcium level is related to the fact that hypocalcaemia results from chronic generalized renal failure [19]. But since accumulation of oxalates over time can cause derangement of renal functions  one could see a possibility (although  not experimentally confirmed fact) that the noted reduced calcium level could have very well resulted from any slight compromise in the renal tubules ions transport system [20] of the extract-treated rats. However  the significantly decreased (p  0.001) serum creatinine level  and bilirubin level are much more supportive of enhanced renal (and liver) functions [21  22].

In recent times  a number of studies were carried out on the suitability and efficacy in gastroduodenal ulcer prevention  treatment and management of several plants used in folkloric medicine. This study investigated the gastroprotective effect of ethyl acetate fraction of Nigella sativa L. (family: Ranunculaceae) seed extract on gastric hormonal changes of prostaglandins  somatostatin and gastrin with the aid of ELISA kits in adult male albino Wistar rats using indomethacin as the necrotizing agent. The rats were grouped into 5 groups and subgroups of 5 rats each and treated with extract fractions at 50  100 and 200 mg/kg subcutaneously  followed with indomethacin and cimetidine used as the standard drug. Preliminary phytochemical screening of the plant extract fraction revealed the presence of flavonoids  alkaloids  tannins  saponins  steroids and glucocinolates  while the LD50 of the extract fraction was found to be above 5000 mg/kg subcutaneously in rats according to Lorkeâ€™s method. There was a significant increase (p0.05) in the prostaglandins and somatostatin levels in a dose-dependent manner with highest increase at the dose of 200 mg/kg with consequent decrease in the level of gastrin compared to the control. The results of this study suggest the gastroprotection and safety of the Nigella sativa fraction dose used in this study. Keywords: Gastroprotection  Gastroduodenal ulcer  Indomethacin  Nigella sativa ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ï¿¼ ï¿¼ï¿¼INTRODUCTION Peptic ulcers occur worldwide (Cemek et al.  2010) and are major causes of morbidity and mortality (Chaturvedi et al.  2007). Both gastric and duodenal ulcers are illnesses that affect a considerable number of people in the world and some researchers consider gastric ulcer as the new â€œplagueâ€ of the 21st century (Oâ€™Malley  2003). It is estimated that about 10% of the worldâ€™s population will have an ulcer at some point during their lives (Hiruma-Lima et al.  2001). Factors such as stress  cigarette smoking  nutritional deficiencies  inadequate dietary habits  hereditary predisposition and frequent ingestion of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 54 Saleh et al.  Nig. Journ. Pharm. Sci.  September  2014  Vol. 13 No.2  P 54-61 drugs (NSAIDs) increase the gastric ulcer incidence (Klein et al.  2010). The mucosal barrierâ€™s ability to resist gastric injury requires the integrity of cytoprotective factors such as the pre-epithelial mucus bicarbonate layer  the intercellular tight junctions connecting the epithelial cells  the submucosal acid sensors  the presence of prostaglandins  cytokines  enteric nerves and blood flow (Ham and Kaunitz  2007). Cyclooxygenase (COX) is constitutively expressed in the gastrointestinal tract in large amounts and has been reported to maintain mucosal integrity through continuous generation of prostaglandins. The COX- produced prostaglandins promote enhancement of gastric mucosal protection by stimulating mucus and bicarbonate secretion  epithelial cell proliferation and increasing mucosal blood flow (Halter et al.  2001). The gastric ulcer production by indomethacin is due to the fact that this compound inhibits the synthesis of cytoprotective prostaglandins  synthesized by COX-1 and COX-2 in the stomach tissue (De Souza et al.  2002). In developing countries  usually 50-90% of the populations are infected with Helicobacter pylori  which is the main organism responsible for majority of peptic ulcer cases  and children acquire the infection soon after being weaned. For example  in West Africa  80% of children may be infected with the organism by age five. Many natural products and modern synthetic drugs have been used to treat the peptic ulcer disease  but so far a complete cure has not been achieved or discovered  and exploration of new anti- ulcer drugs has remained a field of active research (Bandyopadhyay et al.  2001). Although there are many products in the market for the management of gastric ulcers  including antacids  proton-pump inhibitors  anticholinergics and H2-receptor antagonists  most of these drugs produce several adverse reactions  such as hypersensitivity reactions  arrhythmias  impotence  gynaecomastia  nephrotoxicity  and haemopoetic changes (Chang and Leung.  2002; Schol,,Abdel-Aziz  Mohamed Mabrouk is a Professor of Human Physiology  Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences  Bayero University  Kano  M.D. holder from Al-Azhar University  Cairo.

Thermo-catalytic and bio- conversion of wastes and biomass into useful industrial feedstock and energy - This represents my research into low and high temperature conversion of biomass and agricultural residues into oils  chars and fuels. The oils are rich in technical fatty acids which can further be processed into alcohols  chemicals and alternative energy source as biodiesel. The char produced can be activated by gasification to produce active carbons which can be used for adsorption processes in water purification. The residues produced from the thermo-catalytic conversion can be processed into agricultural fertilizers.  3.
