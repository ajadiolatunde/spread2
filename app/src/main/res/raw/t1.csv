Oigiangbe Received: 6 June 2017 / Accepted: 13 September 2017  Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2017 Abstract Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) is an important cash  food and nutritional security grain legume crop in the semi-arid regions of sub-Saharan Africa. However  its productivity is hampered by several biotic stress factors including numerous insect pests that infest and damage the crop at all its development stages in the field as well as during storage. Host plant resistance is an environmentalfriendly  cost-effective and sustainable pest management option for minimizing the pestsâ€™ incidence and severity. This review article aims at describing the major insect pests in cowpea and highlight key past and recent research findings in cowpea resistance to insect pests. It also provides in-depth knowledge in the host-plant resistance mechanisms in cowpea i.e. biophysical  biochemical and physiological factors that regulate the defense systems in the plant. Furthermore  the paper discusses the need for advanced investigation on the genetic basis of the plant defense systems and its application to the crop breeding program for developing new improved materials. The review would support the cowpea breeding program with the overall expectations of developing insect-resistant lines  reducing the input costs of insecticides while also enhancing cowpea productivity in sub-Saharan Africa. Keywords Vigna unguiculata  Plant defense systems  Breeding  Varietal resistance  Productivity  Insect pests Introduction Cowpea (Vigna unguicalata (L.) Walp.) (Fabaceae) is one of the most important grain legumes for human and livestock nutrition in sub-Saharan Africa. It is relatively well adapted to various agro-ecosystems especially the semi-arid and hot regions (Coulibaly et al. 2009) and soils with variable pH levels and more than 85% sand (Obatolu 2003; Singh 2014). About 70% of the world cowpea production is from the dry Savanna and Sahel Zones of West and Central Africa (Timko et al. 2007). In West Africa particularly  cowpea is part of the traditional cropping systems and is becoming a strategic crop because of its multiple A. Togola (&)  O. Boukar  N. Belko  S. K.

The grain of cowpea is the major source of protein (20â€“32%)  minerals and vitamins in the diet of majority of rural and modest city communities (Gowda et al. 2000; Sule and Bello 2006; Timko et al. 2007; Egho 2010; Boukar et al. 2013; Singh 2014). It also contains other essential micronutrients such as calcium  iron  thiamine and riboflavin (Bressani 1985; Voster et al. 2007)  making cowpea an important food and nutritional security crop in sub-Saharan Africa (Nielsen et al. 1993). However  despite its importance  cowpea grain yield remains very low (100â€“500 kg ha-1) in famersâ€™ field growing conditions compared to the potential yield (1.5â€“3.0 t ha-1) (Rachie 1985; Karungi et al. 2000; Asante et al. 2001; Asiwe et al. 2009; Boukar and Fatokun 2009; Oyewale and Bamaiyi 2013; Singh 2014). This very low yield is imputable to a complex of biotic and abiotic stress factors including insect pests  diseases  parasitic weeds  heat  low soil fertility and drought. Above all  insect pestsâ€™ infestation and damage have the most negative impact on cowpea productivity in all cropping locations worldwide (Singh and Jackai 1985). Average grain yield losses range between 50 and 80% in untreated fields (Singh and Allen 1980) and can reach 90â€“100% under high pest infestation conditions (Jackai and Daoust 1986; Singh 2014). The extent of insect pestsâ€™ infestation and the severity of their attacks and damage in cowpea field vary from one location to another and depend on the plant developmental stage. Application of synthetic insecticides remains the most common measure used so far to combat insect pests in cowpea. However  because of the potential hazards caused by chemicals to humans (users and consumers)  animals and the environment  and possible development of insecticide resistance by the insect pests  efforts have been made to seek eco-friendly alternative options including cultural practices  biological control  use of biopesticides and resistant varieties. Among these options  varietal resistance appears to be the most costeffective and environmentally friendly approach to mitigate insect pestsâ€™ effects on cowpea production and value-chain (Ofuya and Lale 2001; Fatokun 2002). Indeed  plant self-defence systems including the biochemical and biophysical systems  play a major primary role in controlling pest either by killing them  affecting their physiology and behaviour  or serving as anti-feedant or repellent. Varietal resistance is the first line of defense against cropsâ€™ insect pests and should be one of the major criteria in the development and release of new cultivars to ensure cost-effective production (Sharma and Crouch 2004). Cowpea host plant resistance can be improved genetically through breeding and biotechnology applications (Boukar and Fatokun 2009) to create new lines with desired plant and grain qualities. In the past  several studies were conducted to identify cowpea genotypes with resistance against various insect pests (Woolley and Evans 1979; Chalfant 1985; Chambliss and Hunter 1997; Devereau et al. 2002). This review describes the key insect pests of cowpea  provides a non-exhaustive list of cowpea lines that were identified from past and recent studies as insect-resistant and gives an overview of the mechanisms and principles of host plant resistance to be considered as future prospects for cowpea breeding and improvement in Africa. Overview of insect pests of cowpea in sub-Saharan Africa Insect pests represent the major limiting factor of cowpea production in SSA. A wide range of the pests causes devastating damage during the crop developmental stages and storage as well (Jackai and Daoust 1986). The high diversity of insects and their high preference for cowpea explain their regular presence in both field and store. The preponderance of insect pests in SSA cowpea fields may be the result of coevolution since cowpea is indigenous to the subregion. Every growth stage of the crop has at least one major insect species that can cause significant negative impact on the plants growth and subsequently substantial losses in grain yield if chemical treatment is not well applied in due course (Singh et al. 1990; Jackai and Adalla 1997; Fatokun 2002; Boukar and Fatokun 2009). Over 85 insect species attack cowpea in one way or another (Booker 1965) with about 20 of them with regular occurrence and economic importance in various cowpea production areas worldwide (Oyewale and Bamaiyi 2013). In Africa  the most widespread and damaging insect pests include the cowpea aphid Aphis craccivora Koch  Mirperus spp. and Lygus spp.  the foliage beetles Ootheca spp. and 239 Page 2 of 16 Euphytica (2017) 213:239 123 Medythia spp.  the hairy caterpillar Amsacta moloneyi Druce  the leafhopper Empoasca spp.  the beanfly Ophiomyia phaseoli Tryon  the whitefly Bemisia tabaci Gennadius  the flower beetles Decapotoma affinis Billb  Mylabris senegalensis Voigts and Coryna agenteata F.  the leaf-footed plant bug Leptoglossus australis Fabricius  the flower bud thrips Megalurothrips sjostedti Trybom and Sericothrips occipitalis Hood  the leaf thrips Hydatothrips adolfifriderici Kamy (Thysanoptera: Thripidae)  the legume pod borer Maruca vitrata Fabricius  the pod sucking bugs complex Clavigralla tomentosicollis Stal  Anoplocnemis curvipes (F.)  Riptortus spp.  and the cowpea weevil Callosobruchus macufutus (F.). A comprehensive list of these major insect pests is presented in Table 1. Among the cowpea field pests  M. vitrata  A. craccivora  C. tomentosicollis and M. sjostedti are the most economically important and most widespread within the cowpea cropping agro-ecologies worldwide (Malgwi and Onu 2004; OECD 2015). Other species like the green stink bug Nezara viridula Linnaeus  the leaffooted bug Leptoglossus phyllopus (L.) and the cowpea curculio Chalcodermus aeneus Boheman are also economically important but their occurrence is either sporadic or limited to some continents or regions. As for storage pests  Callosobruchus macufutus (F.) and C. chinensis (L.) are widely distributed  while C. rhodesianus (Pit.) and C. subinnotatus (Pit.) are restricted to southern and western Africa  respectively (Mbata 1993). Concept of host plant resistance to insect pests Host plant resistance (HPR) is the genetically inherited qualities in the plant that determine the ultimate degree of damage done by a pest (Painter 1951). It is associated with the ability of plants to ward off or withstand attacks and recover from injury due to a pest (Kogan 1994). Plant resistance is driven by some mechanisms or principles. Mechanisms of plant resistance to insect pests The host plant resistance involves very complex principles or mechanisms that were classified into 3 main categories: antibiosis  antixenosis (nonpreference) and tolerance (Painter 1951; Farrar Jr and Kennedy 1991). â€“ Antibiosis is the property of the host plant to affect the life of an insect when it uses the plant as food (Painter 1951; Kogan 1994). Antibiosis is essentially due to plant biochemical compounds. Plant with antibiosis effect can kill insect or disrupt some functions of its biology. Some antibiosis characteristics were detected with resistance to different biotype of cowpea aphid conferred by single dominant genes (Ombakho et al. 1987; Bata et al. 1987; Pathak 1988). â€“ Antixenosis is the property of the host plant in which insect perceives the undesirability to use it for food  oviposition or shelter (Painter 1958). Plant physical and biochemical factors making the plant a refractory â€˜â€˜guestâ€™â€™ (xenos in Greek) for the insect are the main cause of non-preference (Kogan 1994). The repellence or/and disruption of insect behavior are the main effects of this mechanism. â€“ Tolerance is the ability of host plant to withstand the pestsâ€™ infestation or recover from insectsâ€™ attack. Plantâ€“insect friendly coexistence is the main rule of this mechanism. Plant defense systems Resistance is a response of plant defense system that affects the life  physiology or behaviour of the pests (Cortesero et al. 2000; Dicke and Baldwin 2010; Mahipal 2016). Many cowpea lines have good resistance systems against insect pests (OECD 2015). They are described as follows: Physical defense factors The plant physical defences comprise morphological and anatomical features. They are natural barriers such as trichomes  hairs  pod wall hardness  etc. (Cortesero et al. 2000) that protect plant from invasion or give the plant good strength and rigidity. In both cultivated and wild cowpea relatives  many morphological characters were found to be associated with pest-non preference proprieties. For instance  the dense and long trichomes on some cowpea cultivars were found to increase their resistance to the pod borer M. vitrata (Jackai and Oghiakhe 1989; Oghiakhe et al. 1992; Oigiangbe et al. Euphytica (2017) 213:239 Page 3 of 16 239 123 Table 1 Major insect pests of the cowpea crop and stored grains in Africa Crop developmental stages Insect pests common names Insect pests scientific names Occurrence/damage Seedling and vegetative stage Foliage beetles Ootheca mutabilis Shalberg O. bennigseni Weise (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) They are foliage pests feeding on cowpea seedlings and newly emerged leaves. They are also vectors of cowpea yellow mosaic virus (Singh and Allen 1979). Yield losses of between 27 to 100% are recorded from direct feeding damage to foliage or from virus disease (Ekesi 2001) Striped foliage beetles Medythia quaterna Fair/Paraluperodes quaternus Fairnaire (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) They are foliage pests that feed on cowpea seedlings and newly emerged leaves at the margins. They are important vectors of cowpea mosaic virus (Singh and Allen 1979). Although specific yield loss estimates are not available  these beetles are reportedly major pest of cowpea (Egho 2011) Hairy caterpillars Amsacta moloneyi Druce (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) This hairy caterpillar is a major foliage pest of cowpea at the beginning of the growing season but the occurrence is sporadic in many cowpea production areas. A single wave of hairy caterpillar can completely destroy cowpea fields at seedlings stage (Cisse and Hall 2003) Leafhoppers Empoasca spp. E. dolichi Paoli E. christiani Dworakowska E. knudseni Dworakowska (Homoptera: Cicadellidae) These are foliage pests  making severe attacks at seedling stage leading to yellow discoloration and cupping of leaves as well as premature dryness of the seedling (Singh and Allen 1979). Yield losses between 10% and 35% were recorded under heavy leafhopper infestation in cowpea lines (Singh 1987) Cowpea aphid Aphis craccivora Koch (Homoptera: Aphididae) This is a key foliage pest of cowpea. The adults and nymphs feed on the under-surface of young leaves  stem tissues  growing tips  stems  petioles  flowers and pods of mature plants by sucking the fluid (Singh and Allen 1979). The attack results in stunting  leaf distortion  premature defoliation and death of seedlings. Also they cause honeydew deposit on pods and leaves leading to mould formation (Singh 1985). A. craccivora transmits cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus (Ofuya 1997). The damage is particularly severe on cowpea grown in the dry season (Jackai and Daoust 1986). Yield loss can reach 50% and more when high infestations of cowpea aphids are not controlled or in case of transmission and spread of legume viruses even at low population densities (Obopile and Ositile 2010) Leaf miner Liriomyza trifolii Burgess (Diptera: Agromyzidae) liation and death of seedlings This fly causes direct damage  particularly on young plants  the leaf of which may be completely destroyed. Larvae produce continuous mines in leaves and young stems. Although specific yield loss estimates are not established  the mines of the larvae and feeding punctures by the adult often lead to severe defoliation (Jackai and Daoust 1986; Neuenschwander et al. 1987) Beanfly or Stem fly Ophiomyia phaseoli Tryon (Diptera: Agromyzidae) This is a major foliage pest of cowpea which mines leaves upon hatching and then moves to the veins and stems. An estimate of 90 to 100% seedlings mortality can occur under severe infestation (Somaatmadja and Sutarman 1978) The whitefly Bemisia tabaci Gennadius (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) This is a foliage pest of cowpea which causes direct damages by feeding on the phloem sap. Itâ€™s also a vector of the cowpea Golden mosaic Virus (GMV) and can spread it between fields in infested areas (Anno-Nyako et al. 1983; Horowitz and Ishaaya  2014). Cowpea is among the main crops affected by whitefly-transmitted virus diseases (Morales  2001) but no yield loss estimate is available 239 Page 4 of 16 Euphytica (2017) 213:239 123 Table 1 continued Crop developmental stages Insect pests common names Insect pests scientific names Occurrence/damage Flowering stage Cowpea flower thrips Megalurothrips sjostedti Trybom (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) This is the first major insect pest of cowpea at the reproductive stage. It attacks terminal leaf buds  racemes (flower buds) and flowers resulting in browning  distortion  abscission and abortion of flower buds. Its damage can cause shortening of peduncles. The population of this pest is often higher during the dry season (Jackai and Daoust 1986; Abudulai et al. 2006; Omo-Ikerodah et al. 2008). This pest alone can cause 100% yield loss (Singh 1987) Blister beetles Decapotoma affinis Billb. Mylabris senegalensis Voig. Coryna agenteata F. (Coleoptera: Meloidae) They are flowering pests feeding on flower petals with minor incidence on grain yield Post-flowering and podding stages Legume Pod borer Maruca vitrata Fabricius (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) Also called Spotted pod borer  M. vitrata is a post-flowering pest considered to be the most damaging and economically important field insect pest of cowpea in sub-Saharan Africa. Larvae feed on tender parts of the stem  peduncles  flower buds  flowers and pods. They make webs on these organs and provoke flower abortion (Singh and Allen 1979). Losses up to 80% were reported as a result of pod borer attack on cowpea (Dannon et al. 2010) Cowpea seed moth Cydia ptychora Meyrick (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) This is a post-flowering pest. The first instar larva enters the pod and feeds on the developing seeds. Damage between 20 and 30% of the pods were reported during larval infestations (Jackai and Daoust 1986) The Pea-blue   or long-tailed Peablue Lampides boeticus Linnaeus Synonym: Lycaena boetica Linnaeus (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) This is a post-flowering pest. The larva feeds on flowers  seeds and pods of cowpea. Many Fabaceae species are host plants of this species (Woodhall 2005). The damage on cowpea is sporadically limited to few fields Pod sucking bugs complex Clavigralla tomentosicollis StaÂ¨l. and Anoplocnemis curvipes (F.) (Heterooptera: Coreidae) Riptortus dentipes Fabricius and Mirperus jaculus Thunb. (Heteroptera : Alydidae) These bugs are serious pests of cowpea during post-flowering stage. Both nymphs and adults damage the seeds by inserting their stylets through the pod wall to suck nutrient from the developing seeds (Jackai et al. 2001). Infested pods show pale yellow patches  seeds shriveled and lose germination ability. The uncontrolled infestation of these insects on cowpea causes losses in the magnitude of 80% and 95% of pod and seed yield respectively (Egho 2011) Post-harvest and storage stage Cowpea bruchids Callosobruchus maculatus Fabricius C. chinensis Linnaeus C. subinnotatus Pic (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) Also called cowpea beetles  or cowpea weevils  the bruchids are considered as the most important and common storage pest of cowpea (Amusa et al. 2013). The losses in grain yield can reach 90 to 100% in case of long term storage without treatment. In many cases  the source of infestation is the field where the crop is grown (Sallam and Bothe 1999) Bruchidius atrolineatus (Pic.) Coleoptera: Bruchidae) This storage pest is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. Its infestation starts in the field and  in most cases  continues in storage. The direct feeding on cowpea seeds leads to severe injury and considerable economic losses (Taylor 1981) Acanthoscelides obtectus Say and Zabrotes subfasciatus Boheman (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) Originated from South and Central America these weevils are now widely distributed in the tropical and sub-tropical countries of West  North and Central Africa (Taylor 1981). Under high infestation  total losses of cowpea grains have been reported after 4â€“5 months of storage (Paul et al.2009) Cowpea weevil Piezotrachelus varius Wagn. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) This apionid is the only true weevil causing significant damage to cowpeas in Africa. The infestation originates in the young pods of cowpea (Prevett 1961) and continues during the storage. Seed damages of 26% and 92% have been recorded in Senegal and Nigeria  respectively  due to P. varius (Jackai and Daoust 1986) Euphytica (2017) 213:239 Page 5 of 16 239 123 2006) and also to the pod sucking bugs (Oigiangbe et al. 2002  2006). Similarly  the dense hairs found on different parts of the wild cowpea V. vexillata have been associated with resistance to pod-sucking bugs and pod borer (Oghiakhe et al. 1992; Boukar et al. 2013). Pod wall strength and hardness are considered as important traits for resistance to pods borers (Rymal and Chambliss 1981; Oigiangbe et al. 2002). Thick and compact collenchyma cells in the stems and fibrous tissues on the petal surface contributed to resistance to flower insect pests. The findings of this study (Oghiakhe et al. 1991) showed that the stem epidermis was associated with severe limitations on M. vitrata larval movement and feeding. Resistance in TVu-946 to M. vitrata was associated to its erect type and profuse flowering (Oghiakhe et al. 1992). Pods of TVu-9930 were observed to have especially harsh surface texture which may explain the inability of A. craccivora to colonize the plants (Ofuya 1993). A wild relative of cowpea  TVNu-72 showed resistance to pod sucking bugs because of the sclereids or other strengthening tissues on its pods (Jackai et al. 2001). Other wild Vigna species with resistance to M. vitrata and the pod sucking bugs include V. unguiculata ssp. dekindtiana  V. luteola  V. oblongifolia and V. recticulata (Singh et al. 1989). Finally  it was reported that cowpea varieties with pigmented calyx  petioles  pods and pod tips suffer less damage from M. vitrata (Singh et al. 2002). Biochemical defense factors The chemical bases of insect-plant interactions are one of the most important aspects of HPR. Direct chemical defences are due to a wide range of secondary metabolites (Allelochemicals) acting as toxins  repellents  digestibility reducers  feeding deterrents  or acting as precursors to physical defense systems (Bennett and Wallsgrove 1994; Cortesero et al. 2000). They are essentially phytochemical compounds such as non-protein amino acids  cyanogenic glycosides  alkaloids  terpenoids  tannins  lignin  flavonoids  etc. that negatively affect the physiology or behaviour of the pest (Bennett and Wallsgrove 1994; Lattanzio et al. 2000; Dicke and Baldwin 2010). The activities of the phytochemicals comprise nervous system inhibition  tissue malformation  feeding deterrence (bitterness)  enzyme inhibition  growth inhibition  hemolymph coagulant  toxin  digestive or respiratory inhibition. They are involved in both antibiosis and antixenosis mechanisms (Kogan 1994). It was reported that cowpea varieties with high levels of antibiosis prevent insect pests from establishing massively on the plants (van Emden 1991). The wild cowpea line TVNu 1158 was identified as resistant to aphid (Souleymane et al. 2013) and was found to have such resistance gene (Omoigui et al. 2017). Secondary metabolites such as polyphenols  terpenoids and flavonoids can reinforce the resistance of cowpea to M. sjostedti and M. vitrata (Oigiangbe et al. 2001; Alabi et al. 2011). The ethyl-acetate content in the stems of TVu-946 showed greater feeding inhibition against M. vitrata (Otieno et al. 1985; Soundararajan et al. 2013). Many authors have reported that high plant phenols content increases resistance to insect pests (Zucker 1972; Rowell-Rahier 1984; Bennett and Wallsgrove 1994). Some cultivars that produce high level of volatile compounds are less attractive to cowpea curculio (Rymal and Chambliss 1981). Good resistance in TVu-36  TVu-408  TVu- 410  TVu-801  TVu-2896 and TVu-3000 to A. craccivora was found to be due to their relatively high phenolic and or flavonoid contents (Ofuya 1997). A study done by MacFoy and Dabrowski  (1984) pointed out that an increase in total phenols and flavonoids content in the stem of TVu-310 and 408-p-2 was associated with high resistance to aphid infestation. As for the total sugars content  the same authors found more in the susceptible line Vita-1 compared to the resistant TVu-310. They argued that the basis of aphid resistance in cowpea might be antixenosis and antibiosis properties of the genotypes. Cyanogenic heterosides  flavonoids  tannins and trypsin inhibitors were identified in IT86D-716 as antibiosis compounds against the C. tomentosicollis (Dabire-Binso et al. 2010). Some biochemical compounds with potential effects on cowpea insect pests are summarized in Table 2. Physiological patterns Some physiological factors such as plant growth habit  recovery capacity from pest-injury  early maturity  high flower production  etc. are part of the plant tolerance traits. Some of these traits were found associated with increased tolerance of cowpea to field insect pests. For instance  it was reported that cowpea cultivars with pods independently exerted from plant 239 Page 6 of 16 Euphytica (2017) 213:239 123 canopy suffer less damage by M. vitrata (Usua and Singh 1979). Similarly  some studies conducted by Okeyo-Owuor and Ochieng  (1981) and MacFoy et al. (1983) found that TVu-946 with less dense canopy was less preferred by M. vitrata for oviposition than the cultivar Vita-1 that has denser leaf canopy because adults of the pod borer prefer dark environments. Some cowpea varieties (e.g. IT91 K-180) tolerate a high population of thrips by producing more flowers and pods to compensate the pestsâ€™ damage (Alabi et al. 2003). Genetics of the resistance The success in developing varieties resistant to biotic stresses depends on the availability of sources of resistance gene and the inheritance of such resistance (Rubiales et al. 2015). Factors regulating host plant resistance are carried either by several minor genes (polygenic resistance) or by single major gene (monogenic/oligogenic resistance). Polygenic resistance is suitable for controlling multiple pests. Several insect-resistance traits are found to be polygenic type but their introgression into new varieties is much more complex than that of monogenic resistance (Kogan 1994). However  the progress in biotechnology has facilitated the rapid introgression of targeted genes and traits  regardless of whether polygenic or monogenic (Sharma et al. 2002). In past and recent times  research efforts have been made to evaluate thousands of cowpea accessions for resistance to major pests such as A. craccivora  M. vitrata  M. sjostedti  C. maculatus  Empoasca spp.  etc. and for some cases the genetic basis of resistance has been established. The monogenic nature of the aphid resistance was established in some cowpea varieties (van Emden 1991; Ofuya 1993  1997) but in some cases the resistance was easily overcome by new biotypes of the insect pest. Also it is now known that the single dominant gene that conferred resistance to aphid in TVu-3000 and transferred to several improved cowpea varieties is no longer effective due probably to gene resistance broken down (Bata et al. 1987; Pathak 1988). More than 8500 accessions of cowpea were evaluated for resistance to pod borer and pod-sucking bugs  and more than 4000 accessions were evaluated for resistance to flowering thrips and bruchid from 1984 to 1988 (Boukar et al. 2013). Among them  several varieties have been identified with moderate or high level of resistance to many species except M.

An inventory of some cowpea accessions with good level of resistance to insect pests is shown in Table 3. Progress made in cowpea breeding for resistance to insect pests in SSA Breeding for improved insect pests resistant varieties is a sustainable strategy for crop production especially in SSA where accessibility and affordability synthetic insecticides are an issue. In addition to being ecofriendly  it can particularly enhance the cropsâ€™ productivity and value chain. This will therefore insure the regular availability of pest-resistant varieties that will be more attractive to farmers by decreasing their input costs and enhancing their profits (Fatokun 2002; Hall et al. 2003). According to Painter 1951  the cultivation of pestsâ€™ resistant varieties must occupy the first line of defense against insect pests although this can be reinforced by other controlled measures. The value of plant defense systems rests on the development and use of pest-resistant crop varieties (Smith 1989; Cortesero et al. 2000). Breeding for resistance to insect pests has occupied an important place in cowpea improvement program in SSA with the objective of finding genetic sources of resistance to major pests (Semple 1992; Boukar and Fatokun 2009). Through conventional breeding  many improved cowpea lines with highly desirable plant and grain traits have been developed (Boukar and Fatokun 2009; Boukar et al. 2015). Some of these varieties that have moderate to good levels of resistance to various insect pests (e.g. A. craccivora M. sjostedti and M. vitrata)  diseases and parasitic weeds  have been released to farmers (OECD 2015; Boukar et al. 2015). Since 1990â€™s  advances in biotechnology such as marker assisted selection have accelerated the research in host plant resistance to cowpea insect pests (Jackai and Adalla 1997). The cowpea breeding programs in SSA are applying these tools in order to introgress desirable traits into improved varieties (Boukar and Fatokun 2009; Boukar et al. 2015). A non-exhaustive list of some used markers is shown in Table 4. Also  recurrent selection had been pursued to increase the level of cowpea resistance to multiple insect pests (Ehlers and Hall 1997). Some accessions of wild Vigna species were found to have high levels of resistance to many insect pests of cowpea (Singh et al. 1990; Fatokun et al. 1997; Jackai et al. 2001). Concerted but unsuccessful attempts were made to cross pestsâ€™ resistant wild Vigna species (e.g. Vigna vexillata and V. oblongifolia) with cultivated V. unguiculata (Murdock 1992; Fatokun 2002). On the other hand  genetically modified (GM) cowpea is being developed in some research stations in SSA (ACB 2015). The GM cowpea was modified to carry an insecticidal Cry1Ab gene that encodes a Bt (Bacillus turrigiensis) toxin. It was developed by the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) with Monsanto donating the Cry1Ab and nptII (neomycin antibiotic resistance) genes (Sirinathsinghji 2015). Ghana  Malawi  Burkina Faso and Nigeria are the countries where field evaluations were performed. Field trials were conducted in Nigeria and Burkina Faso from 2014 and in Ghana from 2012. In recent times genetic engineering option had been undertaken for the development of Maruca resistant cowpea. A transgenic cowpea was obtained by inserting the Cry1Ab Bt gene (Popelka et al. 2006). The Bt gene has been transferred through backcrossing to some improved and released cowpea varieties in different countries. These Bt containing varieties have shown resistance to Maruca under confined field trials carried out in some West African countries (Mohammed et al. 2015). One limitation of the native Bt genes is their poor expression in higher eukaryotes (Bett et al. 2017). Indeed  insecticidal proteins need to be expressed at high levels in their plant hosts in order to be effective against targeted insects (Gate,,Oigiangbe  Osawe Nathaniel is a Professor of Entomology (in Crop Protection) in the Faculty of Life Sciences  Ambrose Alli University  Ekpoma  Edo State.

Chairman Faculty Classroom Allocation 3. Member Faculty Projects Committee,12,5,THE CANA EVENT AND THE ROLE OF MARY  On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee.  The mother of Jesus was there  and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited.  And they ran out of wine  since the wine provided for the feast had all been used  and the mother of Jesus said to him  â€˜They have no wine â€™  Jesus said  â€˜Woman  what do you want from me? My hour has not come yet.â€™  His mother said to the servants  â€˜Do whatever he tells you.  There were six stone water jars standing there  meant for the ablutions that are customary among the Jews: each could hold twenty or thirty gallons.  Jesus said to the servants â€˜Fill the jars with water â€™ and they filled them to the brim.  Then he said to them  â€˜Draw some out now and take it to the president of the feast.â€™  They did this; the president tasted the water  and it has turned into wine.  Having no idea where it came from â€“ through the servants who had drawn the water knew â€“ the president of the feast called the bridegroom and said  â€˜Everyone serves good wine first well wined; but you have kept the best wine till now.â€™ This was the first of Jesusâ€™ signs: it was at Cana in Galilee.  He revealed his glory  and his disciples believed in him.  After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and his brothers and his disciples  but they stayed there only a few days (Jn 2:1-12).  There is a common agreement by scripture scholars that the scene in Cana was intended by the evangelist to carry a primary Christological message and not a mariological massage.  In this text also lies the possibility of a secondary sacramental or Eucharistic meaning of the scene.  It should be noted that in the periscope section that precedes the present one under discussion  the disciples had already acknowledged Jesus as the Messiah  the one foretold by Moses and the prophets  the king of Israel and the Son of God.  Jesus had then  said to them â€œYou shall see greater things than theseâ€ (Jn 1:50).  The Cana event  which followed  seemed to indicate the fulfillment of Jesusâ€™ promise  that they would see greater things.  Granted that the dominant motif at Cana is Christological  the mother of Jesus did play an important role  which led to the miracle or sign of changing water into wine.  The mother of Jesus is mentioned in verse one and this immediately sets up the readerâ€™s attention on her. God continues the process of creating new worlds in different ways.  One of the ways in which He does this is through marriages.  The African Bible describes marriage as a mutual agreement between two people to live together as a family and undertake to respect the obligations of a marriage contract.  This is called Ketubah in the Jewish tradition.  It is significant that Jesus chose to work his first miracle during a wedding.  This could indicate his closeness to all families and his readiness to supply their needs.  What I intend to do here  is to take a brief look at and to describe some of the key phrases and words in the text.  a.	Cana in Galilee:  The text says that the wedding took place in Cana in Galilee.  Cana in Galilee is again mentioned in John 4:46 and John 21:2  after which  it is not mentioned again in the New Testament.  The text specifically mentions Cana in Galilee to distinguish the venue of the wedding from Cana in Coele-Syria.  It has been suggested that Cana in Galilee is about 3 Â½ miles North East of Nazareth.  Scholars have also suggested that the Ain Kana which is a little nearer to Nazareth and Khirbet Kana which is 8 miles North of Nazareth could have been the venue for the wedding.  Cana in Galilee or Kefr Kenna seems to be the agreeable traditional venue for the wedding.  Jerome  who stayed in Palestine  says that he could see Cana from Nazareth â€“ indicating that it was no far off?  b.	On the third day: This suggests that Jesus have been coming from somewhere to reach Cana on the third day.  Since there was no travelling on the Sabbath  which for the Jews was the first day of the week  it would appear that the third day of the marriage at Cana would be the forth day of the week that is a Wednesday.  This will not be surprising  since the Jews had a law that the wedding of a virgin should be on a Wednesday.  This was a Talmudical directive to be strictly adhered to by all Jews.  c.	Mary at the Wedding:  It would appear that Mary had a special role to play at this wedding.  When they ran out of wine  she showed concern.  Since she ordered the servants to â€œDo whatever he tells you â€ she appears  by giving them the command  to be in-charge of at least  some of the servants or all of them.  She thus had the authority of ordering them around  so that everything will go on smoothly and successfully at the wedding.  William Barclay has suggested that one of the Coptic gospels which never got into the New Testament  has it that Mary was a sister of the bridegroomâ€™s mother.  He also referred to an early set of the prefaces to the books of the New Testament called the Monarchian Prefaces which says that the bridegroom was John the son of Zebedee whose mother was Salome  the sister of Mary.  However  we cannot be too certain about these details.  Mary was more concerned with the guests and did not want them to feel disappointed.  She was also concerned about the families of the bride and the bridegroom who might be embarrassed by the situation  if the wine ran out.  Her appeal to her Son was therefore not on her behalf or for her own interest  but on behalf of  and for the interest of others.  She has henceforth  continued to play this role of an intermediary.  She was already a mediatrix for all those seeking the fullness of Joy.  She showed herself as ever willing to intercede to her Son on behalf of others  especially when she is invited to do so.  d.	Jesus and his Disciples were also invited:  The Greek word that is used for disciples here is Mathetai which could mean  some members of the twelve or all of them.  In some cases  the same word could be used in a wider sense  that is  not restricted to the twelve (see Mk 2:15; 3:7  Mt 8:21  Lk 6:13  Jn 6:60  61  66 and Jn 20:30).  In the text under discussion  oi mathetai indicates only the disciples at the occasion  whose number is not specified.  In John 20:30  oi mathetai is used in a wider sense to include all the eye-witnesses of Jesusâ€™ works.  From all indications  there is nothing from the passage to suggest that the disciples with Jesus were unexpected guests as William Barclay and some commentators would claim.  Some of these commentators are of the opinion that the wine got finished due to the unexpected number  which came along with Jesus.  This is most unlikely.  Another point that must be made here however  is that the modern notion that â€œwineâ€ in the New Testament means unfermented  non-intoxicating wine is without foundation.  Instead  it could be argued  that it was because Jesus refused to condemn the use of use of wine during celebrations  that He was called a drunkard (Matt 11:19  Lk 7:34) by those who wish to disparage him.  e.	When the wine ran short:  Among the Jewish people  wine was always an essential  during celebrations (see Gen 14:18).  There was even a Jewish saying: â€œWithout wine there is no joy.â€  The shortage of wine as I have observed above  would have been an embarrassment to everybody and the ceremony could easily have been considered or described as deficient.  Drunkenness was considered as a disgrace.  This means that there were occasional drunkards at wedding ceremonies and at other ceremonies.  This trend has continued even in our time.  f.	â€œThey have no wine:â€ When Mary noticed that there was no wine left  she turned to her Son and in a spirit of prayer and intercession  said: â€œThey have no wine.â€ It was a prayer of concern and she knew that her Divine Son had the power of alter the situation (see c. above).  Some commentators are of the opinion that Mary perhaps actually said: â€œThey have no wine  please do something about it.â€  They further suggest that Jesus might have shaken his head to indicate that he would do something and therefore  that sign gave her the authority to order the servants to do whatever he tells them.  However  these are conjectures.  g.	Woman  how does your concern affect me? My hour has not yet come:  This is the translation found in the African Bible.  The Authorized Version of the Bible translation of Jesusâ€™ reply to Mary is: â€œWoman  what have I to do with thee?â€  The late Archbishop Fulton Sheen has given an analysis of this verse  which is useful here.  I will quote him at length. He said: First consider the words  â€œWhat is that to me and to you?â€ this is a Hebrew phrase  which is difficult to translate into English. St. John rendered it very literary into Greek  and the vulgate preserved this literalism in Quid mihi et tibi  which means  â€œwhat to me and to thee?â€ The word â€˜thatâ€™ is not presented in the original phrase; it has been added in the English translation to make the idea more understandable.  Knox translates it freely  â€œwhy dost thus trouble me with that?â€  In order to understand His meaning more fully  consider the words  â€œMy Hour is not yet come.â€  The â€˜hourâ€™ obviously refers to His Cross.  Whenever the word â€˜Hourâ€™ is used in the New Testament  it is used in relation to His Passion  Death and Glory.  References to this â€˜Hourâ€™ are made seven times in John alone  some of which are noted here:  They wanted to arrest him then  but because his hour had not yet come  no one laid a hand on him (John 7:30).  He spoke these words in the Treasury  while teaching in the Temple.  N one arrested him  because his hour had not yet come (8:20). Jesus replied to them: Now the hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified (12:23).  Now my soul is troubled.  What shall I say: Father  save me from this hour? But it is for this very reason that I have come to this hour (12:27).  Listen; the time will come indeed it has come already when you are going to be scattered  each going his own way and leaving me alone  because the Father is with me (16:32).  After saying this  Jesus raised his eyes to heaven and said: Father  the hour has come: glorify your Son so that your Son may glorify you (17:1).  Before the festival of the Passover  Jesus  knowing that his hour had come to pass from this world to the Father  having loved those who where his in the world  loved them to the end. (13:1).  The â€˜Hourâ€™ therefore refers to his glorification through His crucifixion  Resurrection and Ascension.  At Cana  Our Lord was referring to Calvary and saying that the time appointed for beginning the task of redemption was not yet at hand.  His mother was asking for a miracle: he was implying that a miracle worked as a sign of His divinity would be the beginning of His death.  The moment He showed himself before men as the Son of God  He would draw down upon Himself their hatred  for evil can tolerate mediocrity  but not supreme goodness.  The miracle she was asking for would unmistakably be related to His redemption.  His miracle of redeeming a family from embarrassment will be a prelude to the larger miracle of redeeming the world.  Mary was therefore  probably prompting him to begin his work of redemption.  That he acceded to her request shows how much respect he had for his mother.  Her prompting was however  not necessarily informed by her awareness of what she was introducing him into.  The phrase â€œwhat have I to do with you?â€ as translated by the Authorized Version of the Bible was a conversational phrases which  when uttered in anger would mean a complete disagreement and even reproach.  However  when the same phrase is uttered in a gentle soft tone  it may mean  as Barclay suggests: â€œDonâ€™t worry; you donâ€™t quite understand what is going on.  Leave things to me and I will settle them in my own way.â€  The phrase does not therefore always imply reproach as some commentators have claimed  even though it may suggest it.  In this context  it seems to be a gentle suggestion of misunderstanding: â€œI shall see that; it will be better that you should leave it to me.â€  This is the view of Irenaeus.  She was assured that he is aware of all the facts.  It was based on this assurance that she bade the servants to do whatever he orders them to do.  She was quite certain that he will intervene at the right moment.  She had presented the case and was only waiting for his ruling.  He ruled in her favour.  h.	â€œWomanâ€¦:â€ The Greek word used here is guinai. It is used as a vocative and therefore does not convey any idea of rebuke or reproach.  This is clear in John 19:26 where we are told: â€œwhen Jesus saw his mother rand the disciple there whom he loved  he said to this mother; â€œWoman  behold  your son;â€ The point to note here is that when Jesus calls his mother â€˜woman â€™ it always seems to indicate that the time is past for the exercise of any maternal authority on her part.  In other words  when he begins his â€˜Hour â€™ his relationship with her will be altered.  She would no longer be his mother  but the woman who will be the mother of all his spiritual children.  Her future children will no longer be of the flesh  but of the spirit.  Since he will become the new Adam who will redeem the world  she will become the New Eve  the mother of a new humanity.  When Jesus again called his mother â€˜womanâ€™ from the cross and said  â€œBehold my Sonâ€¦â€ John became like the symbol of her new spiritual family.  He consoled his mother while on the cross  by giving her another son  John  not in the flesh  but in the spirit.  i.	Wine:  The use of wine here could be an imagery of the Messianic wedding feast (Isaiah 54:4-8; 62-4-5).  In Amos 9:13; Hos 2:24; Joel 4:18; Isa 29:17; Jer 31:5  the reference to abundant wine is frequently seen as a sign of restoration or of the eschaton.  In any case  it points also to the power of Christ.  The best wine that was served last would appear to be the gradual unfolding of Godâ€™s revelation in the history of salvation.  This best wine  symbolized Jesus.  The first wine that was serve and the water to be turned into wine would seem to represent the prophets  judges  the kings  Abraham  Isaac  Jacob  Moses  etc.  who came before Jesus.  It must be clear however  that this assertion is only a possibility.  Bernard and others argue that the Greek words used here to explain the miracle  have generally been understood to imply that all the water in the six water pots  amounting to about 120 gallons had been turned into wine.  It is possible that this was what the author (John)  meant.  There is  however  the thinking that if that was the case  there was then a large over-provision of the wine for the needs of the guests since they had already consumed what was initially provided by the host.  The author does not say explicitly that the entire contents of the water-pots were turned into wineâ€”neither does he deny that they were all turned into wine.  The water that was turned into wine according to the text was that which was served to the ruler of the feast.  This has created the opening for some commentators to argue that not all the water in the water-pots was change into wine.  But the author  as we have noted  does not say that.  There are arguments in an attempt to prove that this particular narrative is an invention of the evangelist  designed to teach a particular spiritual truth in an allegorical way.  The arguments are  however  weak.  The statement â€œwhen the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that had become wine â€ certainly implies that the facts about the water becoming wine were already known.  It is clear that on tasting the beverage served to him (not knowing anything of its source)  the ruler then said  â€œIt is very good  even better than the one that was served before.â€  From all indications  the story seems to point to an actual occurrence of the incident  which was so magnetic that we are told â€œâ€¦and his disciples began to believe in him.â€ (2:11).  j.	â€¦He and â€¦His brothersâ€¦: There are three theories concerning the reference to â€˜his brother.â€™  The first theory is known as the Hieronymian theory  started by Jerome.  It holds that the reference to â€˜brothersâ€™ was a reference to the sons of Alphaeus  who is identified with Clopas  and Mary  who is regarded as the virginâ€™s sister.  Thus  they were maternal cousins of Jesus and were loosely called â€˜His brothers.â€™  In some passages such as 2 Sam 20:9; 1 Chro 23:21 and Tobit 7:2  4  a cousin is addressed as â€˜brother.â€™ If the Jewish tradition were such that a cousin could loosely be referred to as â€˜brother â€™ and so it seems  it would be no wonder that Jesusâ€™ cousins were called â€˜his brother.â€™  The second theory is the Halvidian theory.  This theory says that the â€˜brothersâ€™ were sons of Joseph and Mary  born after Jesus.  The proponents of this theory quote Matthew 1:25 which says: â€œHe had no relations with her until she bore a son  and he named him Jesus.â€  The argument according to this group then  is that he had relations with her after Jesus had been born and that led to other children-indicating that Mary did not remain a virgin after giving birth to Jesus.  This argument is weak because it is difficult to understand how the doctrine of the virginity of Mary could have been sustained or upheld early in the second century if her so-called four acknowledged sons were prominent Christians.  People would have simply pointed to them and said â€˜Noâ€™ to that doctrine.  In any case  the Greek expression which is translated as â€˜untilâ€™ in Mt. 1:25  does not imply that Joseph had marital relations with Mary after the birth of Jesus.  The idiom â€˜until â€™ neither affirms nor denies the perpetual virginity of Mary.  The Catholic doctrine on the perpetual virginity of Mary simply affirms her unique character in the plan of salvation.  She is seen as the special instrument of the incarnation.  As I have said  in Semitic usage  the word â€˜brotherâ€™ could refer to a wider range of family members that are not actually restricted to blood siblings (cf. Mt. 1246; 13:55; 27:56 and 14:3 where Herod Philip is described as the â€˜brotherâ€™ of Herod Antipasâ€”although the two where what we might call half-brothers).  The third theory is the most probable because it is the most ancient and closer to the time of the events.  This theory is expounded by epiphanies and can be called the Epiphanian theory.  He states that the â€˜brothersâ€™ of Jesus referred to  were sons of Joseph by a former wife.  Therefore  they were the stepsons of Mary  and could naturally be called â€˜brothersâ€™ of Jesus. Now  having taken a look at some basic elements of the text  let me turn to the role played by Mary.  Though I have discussed a bit of her role in c. above  let me just make a few more observations.  2.	The Role of Mary It is certain that it is not only wine that was used in entertaining the guests at the wedding in Cana of Galilee.  There was food to be eaten and the most common food among the Jews at that time was bread.  The wedding therefore was foreshadowing the Eucharist to be instituted by Christ himself  using bread and wine  the same elements used at the wedding.  It is in this connection that Pope John Paul II called Mary â€œWoman of the Eucharistâ€ when he observed thus: Mysterium fidei! If the Eucharist is a mystery of faith which so greatly transcends our understanding as to call for sheer abandonment to the word of God  then there can be no one like Mary to act as our support and guide in acquiring this disposition.  In repeating what Christ did at the last supper in obedience to his command: â€œDo this in memory of me!â€ we also accept Maryâ€™s invitation to obey him without hesitation: â€œDo what he tells youâ€ (Jn 2:5).  With the same maternal concern which he showed at the wedding feast of Cana  Mary seems to say to us: â€œDo not waver; trust in the words of my Son.  If he was able to change water into wine  he can also turn bread and wine into his body and blood  and through this mystery bestow on believers the living memorial of his Passover  thus becoming the â€˜bread of life.â€  Catholic believes that the same maternal concern which Mary showed then  she still shows today.  Just as she interceded on behalf of others at the wedding in Cana  she still intercedes on behalf of these who asks her to.  When Mary told Jesus that they had no wine  it is quite possible that those who had invited her must have told her of their predicament.  Mary approached Jesus with their predicament in trust  knowing that he would act and not disappoint her. She still plays this role  especially on behalf of those who implore her to intercede on their behalf no matter the weight of their predicament. At the visitation  Mary bore in her womb  the Word made flesh.  In a sense therefore  Mary was the first â€˜tabernacleâ€™ in history in which the Son of God  though invisible to the eyes of those who saw her  allowed himself to be adored by Elizabeth.  By allowing himself to be adored through this â€˜tabernacle â€™ he could easily be reached?  The invisible â€˜Eucharist:â€™ which is still being adored today  through the same Mary.  Conclusion I have  in a very brief way  tried to shed some light on some key words and phrases found in the text under discussion.  The analysis presented here is not exhaustive.  More could indeed  be written on the text from different angles.  The text itself has its own difficulties as I have tried to point out.  However  from all indications  the incident of the marriage in Cana of Galilee appears to be a concrete historical event that took place.  We have seen that Mary was concerned  more about offers that about herself? She does not only show concern  but she goes out of her way  to present the concerns of others to the one who perfectly attend to those concerns.  Far from being rebuffed  the reply of Jesus was such that encouraged her to tell the servant to do whatever he tells them to do.  She knew from the depths of her heart  that her Son was not about to disappoint her  otherwise  she would not have given the order she gave.  The same Mary  who mediated on behalf of the couple at Cana  still mediates on behalf of those who seek of her intervention today.  Anyone who feels no need to ask her to mediate on their behalf  does so  not only at their peril  but would have to re-examine their faith in Jesus.  For  to love a son and hate the mother of that son is not only perplexing but close to insanity.  Speaking about Mary and her sinlessness  Fr. Leopoldo said: In the natural order Mary is a daughter of Adam.  In her  therefore  as in all however  by a unique exception in her favour  was made free of that taint.  What should have been the birthright of mankind has became her alone: all others are excluded and she is the sole heiress  enjoying alone all that mankind should have inherited.  She alone can give glory of God and say  â€œI am the Immaculate conception.â€  In 1927  in order to fix his ideas on the subject of Mary  he wrote the following words on a picture of Mary: I  Fr. Leopoldo Mandic Zarevic  firmly believe that the Blessed Virgin as co-redempress of the human race is the moral source of all grace  since everything we receive comes from her fullness.  If the angel did describe her as â€˜full of grace â€™ how can such a person be sinful? Those who have asked her especially through the rosary  to intervene on their behalf  have never been let down.  â€ƒ  NOTES AND REFERENCES  1.	Raymond E.

PETER BAUNA TANKO  Phâ€™D Department of Education Ahmadu Bello University - Zaria  ABSTRACT  Religion can be used for good or evil. Its use by terrorists in recent times brings out the extent to which it could be used for evil.  Mother Teresa of Calcutta has demonstrated how it could be used for good.  This paper showed that defining religion is a hard nut to crack.  It discussed the perspectives on religion from a sociological point of view and insisted as its thesis  that religion  as a phenomenon  cannot be eclipsed and consigned to the dust-bin of history.  The dangers of religion and the fact that it can be a tool for deception were brought out. The paper insists that religion can be meaningful and can  indeed  promote nation building when emphases on love  peace and unity is promoted.  A few recommendations that can foster nation-building have been proposed.   1.	WHAT IS RELIGION?  The concept of religion  like many other important  yet complex concepts  is very difficult to define.  Thwackum (1997) defined religion as: â€œWhen I mention religion  I mean the Christian religion; and not only the Christian religion  but the Protestant religion; and not only the Protestant religion  but the Church of England.â€  This definition is useful only as a warning against defining religion too narrowly  that is  in a way that reflects a particular heritage.  The Abrahamic religions (Judaism  Christianity and Islam) fall into the temptation of attempting to define religion as that which must involve the belief in a single  personal God.  It is important however  to note here that there are other religious traditions that do not agree with this.  Some religions are polytheistic  while others (Buddhism  Taoism)  do not even believe in a divine being.  From the above  there are definitions of religion that have been too general.  For example  the American Philosopher  James (1956) defined religion as: â€œthe feelings  acts and experiences of individual men in their solitude  so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they consider the divine.â€  This definition reflects an individualism that is not present in those religious traditions where the primary focus is the community rather than the individual.  Tillich (1958) says that â€œReligion is ultimate concern.â€  This implies that religion has to do with the ultimate issues and fundamental concerns in a personâ€™s life. There values and beliefs are anchored on their concerns and gives significance to those concerns.  This definition however is too general and does not cover things such as a deeply held commitment to a particular political system.   Idowu (1973)stated that religion is about a fixed relationship between the human self and some non-human entity.  The sacred  the supernatural  the self existent  the absolute  the numinous  or â€œthe Holy â€ the mysterium; the divine or simply  â€œGod.â€ From his definition  religion is a link or a relationship between man and God. Marx (1978) regards religion as some belief founded on superstition.  To him and his students  they feel that religion is a clever device by a few privileged persons in the society to cheat  oppress and subdue the underprivileged.  It is  an invented trick by the powerful to keep the weak permanently down and in a permanent state of submitting to their situations without questioning.  Religion  in short is  for them  the opium of the society.  In his words   â€œReligion is the sob of the oppressed creature  the heart of a heartless world  the spirit of conditions utterly unspiritual.  It is the opium of the poor.â€ Engles and Lenin  are of the same opinion with Marx.  The former says religion is a lie and the later said that religion is one of the aspects of spiritual oppression.  Rogers C. (1982)  defines religion as a â€œbelief in a supernatural power which distinguishes between right and wrong and which provides answers to some of lifeâ€™s ultimate problems.â€ As we have observed  belief goes beyond just believing in a deity.  The anthropologist  Protchord  says that religion is the reciprocal relationship between God and man.  If we believe that God is always and ever kind  then  God does not need to be reciprocated to elicit his kindness.  Defining religion is not easy for the following reasons:  Firstly  there is the problem of the existence of a diversity of religions that have been practiced by different people and at different times  using different rituals.  These religions hold different opinions on questions such as: i.	How many gods are there? ii.	What is the nature of the divine? iii.	Can there be more than one true religion?  Secondly it is difficult to define religion because the concept of religion is broad.  It includes metaphysical beliefs  moral teachings  psychological attitudes  legends  traditions  written scriptures  habitual practices  ceremonies  poetry  song  music  art  dance and theatre  prayer  meditation.  All of these can be constitutive elements of religion and it is extremely difficult to construct them into a good and acceptable definition of religion. (Horner & Westacott  2000).  Thirdly there are scholars who disagree over the claim that all so-called religions (Confucianism) should actually not be called religions.  They reason that Confucianism for example is more of a moral code than a religion.  There are certain small  culturally marginal  historically unsuccessful forms of life or systems of belief that contain certain elements of religion but are classified as â€œcultsâ€ by some scholars rather than call them a religion.  However  it must be stated here  that nearly all religions  appear to have something in common.  It is the idea of a soteriology. This term is derived from the Greek word â€œsoteria â€ meaning  â€œsalvationâ€. The concept of salvation here  goes beyond that of an individual to that of a community.  It does not also  necessarily involve an afterlife.  In the Hebrew Bible  the reference to salvation always includes the idea of the well-being of the community rather than the everlasting happiness of a particular people.  However some indigenous tribal religions of Africa and the Americas are not so much concerned with securing salvation.  They are more concerned with the continuation of things as they are  through good harvest  successful hunting  success in battle  fertility  etc.  Political policies that are directed towards the common good of all peoples  though secular in nature  could be viewed as aiming toward salvation.  This is from the point of view that they seek to lead people from their present less than ideal state to a much more improved state of life.  Policies that empower the majority who are poor  heightened security  the rule of law  etc can be seen as tailored toward salvation.  2.	RELIGION AS A PHENOMENON: SOME PERSPECTIVES September 11  2001 has now  gone down in history as one of those days to be ever remembered in the history of religious fundamentalism. It was the day when Muslim terrorists destroyed the world trade center and a wing of the pentagon  killing over five thousand people. Prior to this attack  Huntington (1996) had poignantly pointed out that at the end of the cold war there would be the  emergence of a paradigm shift from ideology (communism and capitalism) to culture  religion and ethnicity as the dominant parameters for defining the identity of peoples and their relationships. This paradigm shift  he argued  will also define the nature and content of the struggles of peoples.  The denial and relegation of religion  culture and ethnicity by communism and capitalism to the background and the consideration of religion  culture and ethnicity as residual issues in shaping the future was rejected by Huntington (1996). Now  perhaps more than ever  religion  culture and ethnicity are taking center stage in global and local affairs. (Nkom  2006).
